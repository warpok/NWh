\c 13
\p
\v 1 If I can speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but am destitute of love, then my words become no more than annoying noise, going clang, splat, and bang.
\v 2 If I possess the gift of prophecy and am versed in all mysteries and all knowledge, and have such absolute faith that I can remove mountains, but am destitute of love, I am nothing.
\v 3 In fact, if my actions are devoid of love, God would give me no reward at all for selling all my possessions and giving all the proceeds to feed the poor, or even for volunteering my own body to be sacrificed on a firey altar.

\q1
\v 4 Think what people are like when they love you!
\q2 They are patient and kind. 
\q2 They never display envy.
\q2 They are not proudly self-assertive or conceited.
\q3
\v 5 People who display their love do not act rudely or inappropiately.
\q3 They don’t demand their own way.
\q3 They don’t snap out at others in anger,
\q3 and they don't keep a record of how others have wronged them.
\q2
\v 6 If you really love others, you will never be happy to see them acting— or being treated— unfairly.
\q2 If you love someone, you desire for them to live and be treated according to what is true.
\q3
\v 7 If you love someone, you know how to lovingly protect them by staying silent.
\q3 People who are known by their love know how to encourage others by trusting them and hoping the best for them,
\q3 while patiently enduring their faults.

\v 8 Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be done away with; if there are languages, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be brought to an end.
\v 9 For our knowledge is imperfect, and so is our prophesying;
\v 10 but when the perfect state of things is come, all that is imperfect will be brought to an end.
\v 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, felt like a child, reasoned like a child: when I became a man, I put from me childish ways.
\v 12 For the present we see things as if in a mirror, and are puzzled; but then we shall see them face to face. For the present the knowledge I gain is imperfect; but then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
\v 13 And so there remain Faith, Hope, Love— these three; and of these the greatest is Love.
