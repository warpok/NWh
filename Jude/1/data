\v 1 Dear people who have been called and made holy by God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ,
\q2 this message is from Jude, a slave\f + \fr 1:1 \fk slave \ft Text: δοῦλος, bondservant. Neither slave nor bondservant have the right connotations in modern English. Bond servant, meaning a slave hired with a contractual agreement, is a term that is basically unknown today. I judge that the word slave actually fits modern English the best, but it should be borne in mind that a slave of a very important person always has higher status than the slave of a relative nobody.\f* of Christ Jesus and a brother of James.

\v 2 May you always have peace in every circumstance and fully enjoy God's love and mercy.

\v 3 Dear friends, I really wanted to begin a letter to you on the subject of the salvation that we share, but now I find myself constrained to write to urge you to take up the cause of vigorously defending that salvation. Our salvation consists of the body of beliefs that God has once and for all time given to us, the people whom he has made holy.
\v 4 For men who claim to be teachers have crept in unnoticed among us. As I will explain below, these very men have been spoken of in prophetic writings as predestined to be judged for their ungodly behavior. They turn the wonderful kindness of our God into an excuse for their unbridled lust, disowning our only king, our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 5 Although you already know our shared history, I desire to remind you that the Lord saved a people out of the land of Egypt, but afterwards destroyed those who didn't believe.
\v 6 And remember the angels who did not keep the positions originally assigned to each of them, but deserted their proper places. God deposed them from their exalted positions and imprisoned them in darkness. There, in eternal chains, they await the the Judgement Day.
\v 7 Remember also Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns. Not unlike those angels, they totally gave themselves over to gross adultery and unnatural sexual acts. They have become a famous example of what happens to such people, as they suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
\p
\v 8 Yet in just the same way the present day false teachers also defile their own bodies and at the same time reject and insult the higher authorities God has set in place.
\v 9 But even the top-tier angel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about who would gain control of the body of Moses, did not presume to insult the devil. He simply said, “May the Lord rebuke you.”\f + \fr 1:9 \fk disputing … \ft James is refering to a story in the Testament of Moses, which is a Jewish writing from approximately the first century AD.\f*
\v 10 Yet those false teachers are abusive in matters of which they know nothing. At the same time, however, they manage to understand the things animals know instinctively, but those are the very things they corrupt, thus bringing about their own destruction.
\v 11 [Pity//It won't go well for] them, for they have followed in Cain's footsteps! Like Balaam, they are ready to do any evil thing for money. And Iike Korah, they will end up perishing in the rebellion they sponsor.
\v 12 These men boldly join in your fellowship celebrations,\f + \fr 1:12 \fk fellowship celebrations, \ft Text: ἀγάπαις, love (N-DFP). Often translated as love-feasts, this term refers to congregational fellowship suppers where the early church regularly celebrated the sacriment of communion.\f* but are only intested in stuffing themselves and making themselves more important. They are a defiling danger there in your meetings, like big rocks just below the surface of the ocean that cause shipwreck. They are like clouds that hold the promise of needed rain, but which are driven away by the winds. They are as useless as trees that never manage to bear fruit at havest time. They end up doubly dead and uprooted.
\v 13 Like wild waves of the sea, the residue of their shameful deeds casts up a polluting foam. They are like stars who abandon their proper track to wander about aimlessly, who will not escape God's judgment in eternal darkness.
\v 14 It was also about these that Enoch, who belonged to the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, “The Lord, attended by countless thousands of those he has made holy, will come
\v 15 to execute judgment on all the wicked, that is on all those whose wicked thoughts match their wicked deeds. In their wicked sinfulness they heap insults on the Lord himself."\f + \fr 1:15 \fk quote of Enoch \ft This quote is from the First Book of Enoch 1:9, a Jewish writing from the first century BC.\f*
\v 16 These false teachers are always complaining and always pointing out the mistakes of others, while they are themselves guided by their evil desires. It seems they are always either boasting about themselves, or giving exaggerated flattery to others for the sake of gaining something from them.
\p
\v 17 But as for you, dear friends, remember the warnings that were spoken by the representatives of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 18 They predicted, “In the end times (in which we are now living) there will be people who mock true teaching because they are guided solely by their wicked desires."
\v 19 Truly, such false teachers are obsessed by worldly desires. No wonder they cause divisions among us, because they are strangers to the Holy Spirit.
\v 20 But you, my dear friends, continually encourage each other to keep on believing the holy teachings that have been passed down to us, and keep on praying with the help of the Holy Spirit.
\v 21Watch out! Never do anything that makes you feel that you have stepped away from God's love. And keep on waiting for the time our Lord Christ Jesus will return to show his great mercy to us, giving us eternal life.
\v 22 You also must show mercy on those who are only being influenced by false teaching, while making a clear distinction toward those who cannot be helped.\f + \fr 1:22 \fk who are influenced … \ft Text: ελεειτε (PIA) διακρινομενοι (present, middle, participle, nominative, plural, masculine), have mercy making distictions. 88% of manuscripts have this reading with the nominative. Two other variants use the related word doubt. 1Jn. 2:15; 1Jn. 5:16-17.\f*
\v 23 On those for whom you hold on to hope, snatch them from the flames of hell while retaining a healthy dose of fear. Watch that you not stain your heavenly garments by envolvement in their sexual sins.\x + \xo 1:23 \xt Rev. 3:4-5; Rev. 19:8\x*
\v 24 Only our God is fully able to keep them\f + \fr 1:24 \fk them \ft Text: αὐτοὺς, them. This variant has 63% manuscript support.\f* falling away.
