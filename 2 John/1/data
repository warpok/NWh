\v 1 Dear divinely chosen lady,
\q2 this message is from me, an old man.\f + \fr 1:1 \fk an old man \ft Text: Ὁ πρεσβύτερος. The word presbyteros is often translated as ‘elder’ (meaning ‘church elder’). But here, to avoid persecution, John is using the euphemisms of ‘lady’ and ‘children’ instead of writing directly to a specific church. So in this special case, it is better to translate presbyteros according to its non-ecclesiastical meaning, ‘old man’.\f*
\q1 You, together with all your children, really are dear to me.
\q2 That goes not just for me. All of you are dear to everyone who knows the truth,
\q1
\v 2 because the same true teachings\f + \fr 1:2 \fk true teachings \ft Text: την αληθειαν, the truth. When translated literally, I expect that English readers might ask, “Which truth does John refer to?” The answer is that when John says ‘the truth’, he has a number of core truths in mind. You will find them when reading 1 John and his Gospel.\f* are like a living presence glowing\f + \fr 1:2 \fk like a living presence glowing \ft Text: την αληθειαν την μενουσαν, the truth that lives/abides. In English, an abstract noun like ‘truth’ is never said to ‘live’ in someone. Instead we might say, “the spirit of truth lives in him.” (Note the small s.) Here the Greek figure of speech (perhaps coined by John) is translated as ‘like a living presence glowing’ in order to show the miraculous way true teachings actually do ‘live’ in us. Certainly the Holy Spirit is involved, but it would be incorrect to translate it as ‘the Spirit of truth’ in this place. That is probably why English translators have resisted the urge to do so.\f* in our hearts,
\q2 and this will be with us forever.
\p
\v 3 Because we love each other and live according to true teachings, God the Father and His Son— our Lord Christ Jesus— will always be wonderfully kind and merciful to us, giving us peace in any circumstance.
\v 4 It is an intense joy to me to have found some of your children faithfully following true teaching, in obedience to the command which we have received from our Father.
\p
\v 5 And now, dear lady, here is the command that I am sending you: It is not a new one, but I am repeating the one I gave you at the very beginning: Let us love one another.
\v 6 The love of which I am speaking consists in our living in obedience to God’s commands. Simply put, faithfully following all that you were taught is what he commands us all.
\p
\v 7 For many deceivers have appeared now in the world. These men do not acknowledge that Jesus is the prophesied Christ, namely the 0ne prophets foretold would come with a normal human body. Anyone like that is a representative of the great deceiver, who can also be called the anti-Christ.
\v 8 Because of that, don’t let yourself be influenced by them, so that you may not lose the interest on your heavenly investments.\x + \xo 1:8 \xt Luk. 12:33-34\x* The full reward for your good deeds is at stake.
\v 9 But if you follow their misleading teaching and fail to obey the true teaching about Christ, you have stopped following God. On the other hand, if you continue to follow true teaching, you thereby maintain your close connection with God and his Son.
\p
\v 10 If any one who comes to you does not bring this teaching, do not give him a welcoming greeting or receive him under your roof,
\v 11 because even your friendly greeting makes you a sharer in his evil deeds.
\p
\v 12 There is so much more I would like to share with you, but using a pen and ink is not the best way to do it. I hope to see you soon, and it will be so much better to talk in person.
\v 13 The children of your divinely chosen sister send their greetings to you.
