\v 1 Dear brothers and sisters in Galatia, how could you be so foolish? Who tricked you into believing a lie, after knowing the truth?— even after the death of Christ Jesus on the cross was so clearly portrayed for you.
\v 2 I just want to ask you this: Recall how you first received the Holy Spirit. Did that suddenly happen when you started obeying some of Moses' laws, or when you heard the Good News and believed it?
\v 3 It was when you believed, right? So it would be stupid to think that you can walk away from God's Spirit and use your own strength to reach perfection through fulfilling laws.
\v 4 Have you forgotten how you suffered persecation after believing in Christ? Did you learn nothing from those experiences? And do you want to reject all that now?
\v 5 Then ask yourselves: When God empowers you through His Spirit to work miracles, do you think that happens because of obeying the laws of Moses, or is it because you have heard the Good News about Jesus and believed in him?
\p
\v 6 Remember that God's Word says, “Abraham fully believed what God promised him, and that is why God considered him right in his sight.”
\v 7 Notice therefore that those who fully believe in what God promises are like Abraham, so much so that spiritually speaking they become his children.
\v 8 Long ago in God's Word, we read that it was revealed to Abraham that God would make people right in his sight— and this includes even non-Jews— through their believing like Abraham. And God said to him, “All people groups will be blessed through you.”
\v 9 So it's we believers who are blessed— all of us who follow Abraham's example of believing.
\v 10 In contrast, however, those who seek to rely on their own law-keeping ability are under a curse, because God's Word says, “A curse falls on anyone who fails to follow all that is written in the Law.”
\v 11 And even the law itself makes it clear that no one can find acceptance with God through obeying it, because it says, “The ones who fully believe God will be accepted as right in his sight and live forever.”\x + \xo 3:11 \xt Hab. 2:4; Rom. 1:17; Heb. 10:38\x*
\v 12 But note that attempting to impress God through law-keeping is not compatible with finding acceptance with him through believing, because it commands, “If you want to live, keep these commandments.”\x + \xo 3:12 \xt Lev. 18:5\x*
\v 13 [[[]]]Christ has purchased our freedom from the curse of the Law by becoming accursed for us— because “Cursed is every one who is hanged upon a tree.”
\v 14 Our freedom has been thus purchased in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing belonging to Abraham may come upon the nations, so that through faith we may receive the promised Spirit.
\v 15 Brethren, even a covenant made by a man— to borrow an illustration from daily life— when once formally sanctioned is not liable to be set aside or added to.
\v 16 (Now the promises were given to Abraham and to his seed. God did not say “and to seeds,” as if speaking of many, but “and to your seed,” since He spoke of only one— and this is Christ.)
\v 17 I mean that the Covenant which God had already formally made is not abrogated by the Law which was given four hundred and thirty years later— so as to annul the promise.
\v 18 For if the inheritance comes through obedience to Law, it no longer comes because of a promise. But, as a matter of fact, God has granted it to Abraham in fulfilment of a promise.
\p
\v 19 Why then was the Law given? It was imposed later on for the sake of defining sin, until the seed should come to whom God had made the promise; and its details were laid down by a mediator with the help of angels.
\v 20 But there cannot be a mediator where only one individual is concerned.
\v 21 God, however, is only one. Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God? No, indeed; for if a Law had been given which could have conferred Life, righteousness would certainly have come by the Law.
\v 22 But Scripture has shown that all mankind are the prisoners of sin, in order that the promised blessing, which depends on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who believe.
\v 23 Before this faith came, we Jews were perpetual prisoners under the Law, living under restraints and limitations in preparation for the faith which was soon to be revealed.
\v 24 So that the Law has acted the part of a tutor-slave to lead us to Christ, in order that through faith we may be declared to be free from guilt.
\v 25 But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor-slave.
\v 26 You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus;
\v 27 for all of you who have been baptized into Christ, have clothed yourselves with Christ.
\v 28 In Him the distinctions between Jew and Gentile, slave and free man, male and female, disappear; you are all one in Christ Jesus.
\v 29 And if you belong to Christ, then you are indeed true descendants of Abraham, and are heirs in fulfilment of the promise.
