\v 1-3 To every church in the province of Galatia,
\q2 from Paul, an Apostle, and all the brothers and sisters with me.
\q2 May God our Father and the Lord Christ Jesus bless you with their unbounded kindness and peace.
\p I remind you that I was not appointed as an apostle by any human authority, but by Christ Jesus himself, and by God the Father who raised Jesus from among the dead.
\q1
\v 4 According to the plan of God our Father,
\q2 Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for our sins
\q3 in order to rescue us from the present wicked age.

\v 5 All the praise for this belongs to God for ever and ever! Amen.

\v 6 I am shocked that after such a short time you are abandoning the God who showed such kindness to you by calling you to be reconciled with him through Christ, and are going off to follow a different Good News.
\v 7 But there is no such thing as another Good News! People who think they are improving the Good News about Christ are actually distorting it and confusing you.
\v 8-9 Don't be moved! If anyone comes to you preaching a Good News that doesn't line up with what we taught you before, may God throw him into the fire of hell. No matter who it is that teaches a different Good News— even if it is me, a different apostle, or an angel from heaven— let them be sent to Hell.
\p
\v 10 For is it man’s favour or God’s that I aspire to? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still a man-pleaser, I should not be Christ’s bondservant.
\v 11 For I must tell you, brethren, that the Good News which was proclaimed by me is not such as man approves of.
\v 12 For, in fact, it was not from man that I received or learnt it, but by a revelation from Jesus Christ.
\v 13 For you have heard of my early career in Judaism— how I furiously persecuted the Church of God, and made havoc of it;
\v 14 and how in devotion to Judaism I outstripped many men of my own age among my people, being far more zealous than they on behalf of the traditions of my forefathers.
\v 15 But when He who set me apart even from my birth, and called me by His grace,
\v 16 saw fit to reveal His Son within me in order that I might tell among the Gentiles the Good News concerning Him, at once I did not confer with any human being,
\v 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were my seniors in the Apostleship, but I went away into Arabia, and afterwards came back to Damascus.
\v 18 Then, three years later, I went up to Jerusalem to inquire for Peter, and I spent a fortnight with him.
\v 19 I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the Lord’s brother.
\v 20 In making these assertions I am speaking the truth, as in the sight of God.
\v 21 Afterwards I visited Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 But to the Christian Churches in Judaea I was personally unknown.
\v 23 They only heard it said, “He who was once our persecutor is now telling the Good News of the faith of which he formerly made havoc.”
\v 24 And they gave glory to God on my account.
