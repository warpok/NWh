\v 1-3 To every church in the province of Galatia,
\q2 from Paul, an Apostle, and all the brothers and sisters with me.
\q2 May God our Father and the Lord Christ Jesus bless you with their unbounded kindness and peace.
\p I remind you that I was not appointed as an apostle by any human authority, but by Christ Jesus himself, and by God the Father who raised Jesus from among the dead.
\q1
\v 4 According to the plan of God our Father,
\q2 Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for our sins
\q3 in order to rescue us from the present wicked age.
\q1
\v 5 All the praise for this belongs to God for ever and ever! Amen.

\v 6 I am shocked that after such a short time you are abandoning the God who showed such kindness to you by calling you to be reconciled with him through Christ, and are going off to follow a different Good News.
\v 7 But there is no such thing as another Good News! People who think they are improving the Good News about Christ are actually distorting it and confusing you.
\v 8-9 Don't be moved! If anyone comes to you preaching a Good News that doesn't line up with what we taught you before, may God throw him into the fire of hell. No matter who it is that teaches a different Good News— even if it is me, a different apostle, or an angel from heaven— let them be sent to hell.
\p
\v 10 By this time it should be obvious that I am not interested in pleasing people. My aim is to please God. Being a servant of Christ and being a people-pleaser are mutually exclusive occupations.
\p
\v 11 Brothers and sisters, it is important that you know that the Good News I tell to people everywhere wasn't a product of human reasoning.
\v 12 I didn't get information from humans and I didn't become anyone's disciple. The Good News I teach came as a direct revelation from Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 13 You remember that I told you about the way I lived before when I was still following the Jewish religion— how I cruelly persecuted followers of Christ. I attempted to destroy God's church.
\v 14 I was way beyond men of my own age in my devotion to Judaism. No one was more on fire than me for keeping all the traditions of my forefathers.
\v 15-16 But at that time I didn't have a clue that even before I was born, God, in his unbounded kindness, had already chosen that he would one day reveal his son to me. And after that he called me to tell the Good News about his son to non-Jews. Now when that happened, I didn't go off to get advice from any human teacher.
\v 17 For example, I didn't go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before me. Instead I went away into Arabia, and afterwards came back to Damascus.
\v 18 Then, three years later, I went up to Jerusalem to inquire for Peter, and I spent a fortnight with him.
\v 19 I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the Lord’s brother.
\v 20 In making these assertions I am speaking the truth, as in the sight of God.
\v 21 Afterwards I visited Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 But to the Christian Churches in Judaea I was personally unknown.
\v 23 They only heard it said, “He who was once our persecutor is now telling the Good News of the faith of which he formerly made havoc.”
\v 24 And they gave glory to God on my account.
