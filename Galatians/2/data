\v 1 Then, after an interval of fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas and Titus.
\v 2 The Holy Spirit revealed to me that I should go there to meet privately with the church leaders, and I obeyed that instruction. I explained to them the Good News that I tell to the non-Jews, because I didn't want to find out at some later time that I was off base, nullifying everything that I was working so hard for.
\p
\v 3 Now even though Titus— a believer from a non-Jewish background— had come along with me, they did not push that he should be circumcised.
\v 4 Something like that could have happened, because some men masquerading as believers had wormed their way in to the church there. Their purpose was to spy out the freedom which is ours in Christ Jesus, in order to rob us of it.
\v 5 But we didn't, even for a moment, listen to them. We wanted that the pure truth of the Good News would be preserved for you.
\p
\v 6 The leading Jerusalem church leaders didn't suggest any changes to my teaching. Actually, the titles of respect given to those leaders makes no difference to me, because God isn't impressed by human titles.
\v 7-9 But even so, I wanted their approval, and was not disappointed. Those considered the pillars of the movement of Jesus' followers— James, Peter, and John— welcomed Barnabas and me, shaking hands in partnership. They recognized that God had commissioned me as an apostle to preach the Good News to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been commissioned by God to preach to the Jews. And all this was evident by the results given by God. We all agreed that Barnabas and me would continue working among the non-Jews.
\v 10 Their only request was that we would help with financial assistance to the believers suffering poverty in and around the church in Jerusalem, and that was something I have always wanted to do.
\p
\v 11 But some time later, when Peter visited Antioch, there was a time when I needed to directly confront him, as his improper actions were sending mixed signals.
\v 12 When he first arrived in Antioch, he had been freely eating with the non-Jews. But when the group sent by James arrived, he pulled back from the non-Jews and just ate with the Jews, because he didn't want to offend some in that group who were promoting that the non-Jews must be circumcised to follow Jesus.
\v 13 And then the other Jews followed him in calling the non-Jews their brothers but simultaneously acting as if they weren't. Eventually even Barnabas followed along with their hypocrisy.
\v 14 But as soon as I saw that they were not acting genuinely in the spirit of the Good News, I said to Peter, before them all, “Even though you are a Jew, only yesterday you were happy to join the non-Jews around the table. But now you make as if you agree with the Jews who want to force non-Jewish believers to follow Jewish customs! Can't you see this isn't right?”
\p
\v 15 Brothers and sisters, let me admit to you that the Jews frequently refer to all non-Jewish people as ‘sinners’, because the Jews were the first to receive the Mosaic law.
\v 16 Nevertheless, now as believers in Christ, we know that no one will be declared right with God by obeying the law, no matter if they are Jews or non-Jews. The only way to become right in God's sight is through believing in Christ Jesus. So it turns out that we Jews are also ‘sinners’! Therefore even we need to surrender ourselves to him and accept his sacrifice, no longer putting any stock in our obedience to the law, because not one human being will ever be made right in God's sight by keeping the Mosaic law.
\p
\v 17 However some Jewish believers— who have just begun to trust in Christ's sacrifice— feel the lack of their old identity. No longer relying on their own law-keeping, they think, “Oh no. I've turned into a ‘sinner’, just like a non-Jew.” Such feelings are clearly mistaken.
\v 18 But let me show you something that is sinfully wrong: Suppose I come and teach, “Trust in Jesus's sacrifice to be made right with God,” but then I come back and teach, “Forget trusting in Jesus and let's go back to relying on keeping the law.” Don't you see how sinful that would be?
\p
\v 19 Actually, I once tried with all my might to keep the law perfectly, and then I realized, “I can't do it. My sins will kill me.” The solution was to consider myself dead to law-keeping, in order to live for God. Here's how this works:
\v 20 I consider myself crucified with Christ. This means I am no longer directed by my own desires, but by Christ, who lives in me. So the way I live while still in this body is based on my believing that Jesus, the Son of God, loved me so much that he gave his life to save me.\f + \fr 2:20 \fk So the way … \ft Stated more dynamically , “I believe that the Son of God loved me so much that he gave his life for me, and that thought is like the air I breathe which energizes my life in this body.”\f*
\v 21 I don't want to turn my back on God's unbounded kindness which we receive through Christ. Because if we think we can get to heaven by being perfect law-keepers, then it's like boasting, “I'm so good that Christ Jesus didn't need to sacrifice his life for me.”
