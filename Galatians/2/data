\v 1 Then, after an interval of fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas and Titus.
\v 2 The Holy Spirit revealed to me that I should go there to meet privately with the church leaders, and I obeyed that instruction. I explained to them the Good News that I tell to the non-Jews, because I didn't want to find out at some later time that I was off base, nullifying everything I had worked so hard for.
\p
\v 3 Now even though Titus— a believer from a non-Jewish background— had come along with me, they did not push that he should be circumcised.
\v 4 Something like that could have happened, because some men masquerading as believers had wormed their way in to the church there. Their purpose was to spy out the freedom which is ours in Christ Jesus, in order to rob us of it.
\v 5 But we didn't, even for a moment, listen to them. We wanted that the pure truth of the Good News would be preserved for you.
\p
\v 6 The important Jerusalem church leaders didn't suggest any changes to my teaching. Actually, the titles of respect given to those leaders makes no difference to me, because God isn't impressed by human titles.
\v 7-9 But even so, I wanted their approval, and was not disappointed. Those considered the pillars of the movement of Jesus' followers— James, Peter, and John— welcomed Barnabas and me, shaking hands in partnership. They recognized that God had commissioned me as an apostle to preach the Good News to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been commissioned by God to preach to the Jews. And all this was evident by the results given by God. We agreed that Barnabas and me would continue working among the non-Jews.
\v 10 Their only request was that we would help with financial assistance to the believers suffering poverty in and around the church in Jerusalem, and that was something I have always wanted to do.
\p
\v 11 But some time later, when Peter visited Antioch, there was a time when I needed to directly confront him, as his improper actions were sending mixed signals.
\v 12 When he first arrived in Antioch, he had been freely eating with the non-Jews. But when the group sent by James arrived, he pulled back from the non-Jews and just ate with the Jews, because he didn't For until certain persons came from James he had been accustomed to eat with Gentiles; but as soon as these persons came, he withdrew and separated himself for fear of the Circumcision party.
\v 13 And along with him the other Jews also concealed their real opinions, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their lack of straightforwardness.
\v 14 As soon as I saw that they were not walking uprightly in the spirit of the Good News, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, though you are a Jew, live as a Gentile does, and not as a Jew, how can you make the Gentiles follow Jewish customs?”
\p
\v 15 Brothers and sisters, I admit that the Jews frequently refer to people of other races as ‘sinners’, because the Jews were the first to receive the Mosaic law.
\v 16 Nevertheless, now as believers in Christ, we know that no one will be declared right with God by obeying the law, no matter if they are Jews or non-Jews. The only way to be declared right with God is through believing in Christ Jesus. It turns out that we Jews are also ‘sinners’! Therefore we too surrender ourselves to him, no longer putting any stock in our obedience to the law, but believing that Christ will make us right in God's sight. Not one human being will ever be made right in God's sight by keeping the Mosaic law.
\p
\v 17 However some Jewish believers— who have just begun to believe that Christ has made them right in God's sight— feel the lack of their old identity. No longer relying on the law, they think, “Oh no. I've turned into a ‘sinner’, just like a non-Jew.” But .following Jesus will certainly never lead you into sin.
\v 18 But here's a way to become a sinner: Suppose I come and teach, “Believe in Jesus to be made right with God,” but then I come back and teach, “Forget believing in Jesus and let's go back to relying on keeping the law.” Don't you see how sinful that would be?
\p
\v 19 Actually, I once tried with all my might to keep the law perfectly, and then I realized, “I can't do it. My sins will kill me.” It turns out better to consider myself dead to law-keeping, in order to live for God.
\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ that lives in me; and the life which I now live in the body I live through faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself up to death on my behalf.
\v 21 I do not nullify the grace of God; for if acquittal from guilt is obtainable through the Law, then Christ has died in vain.
