\v 1 Dear Gaius,
\q2 This message is from me, your regional elder.\x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1Yoh. 1:1\x*
\q3 Truly, you really are dear to me.
\p
\v 2 Dear friend, I ask God that He make your endeavors prosper in every way and give you good health. On the spiritual front, I am sure you are healthy.
\p
\v 3 It is an intense joy to me when the missionary brothers return and give testimonies about how you so faithfully follow the truth, as shown by the way you live.
\v 4 Nothing gives me greater joy than hearing that one of my children, like you, is faithfully following true teaching.
\p
\v 5 Dear friend, an example of your faithfulness is how you receive the missionary brothers, even when they are strangers to you.
\v 6 They have told the local gathering\f + \fr 1:6 \fk gathering \ft | Text: ἐκκλησίας, often translated as ‘church’ or ‘congregation’. This is the same term that the LXX uses for the gathered community of Israel.\f* here about the way you lovingly receive them and how you help them to get to their next destinations. It is wonderful the way you glorify God by doing this!
\v 7 For their missionary journeys are totally for the cause of Christ. They don't receive support from non-believers.
\v 8 Because of that, it is rightly our duty to show them hospitality, and in that way we become their partners in promoting the truth.
\p
\v 9 I wrote to your local gathering with a similar message. But the road block is Diotrephes, who insists on making all the decisions and doesn't listen to us.
\v 10 For this reason, when I am able to visit your gathering, I will let people know what he is doing, which includes malicious accusations about us. It is not only that, but he doesn't welcome the missionary brothers, and even expells the people who do from the gathering.
\v 11 So, dear friend, let's not follow bad examples, but people who are going the right way. Those who are doing the right thing are simply showing that they're God's children. Those who are not are proving they have no vision of who God is.
\p
\v 12 Now about Demetrius, everyone says good things about him, and he has a proven track record of following true teaching. I join the whole assembly here in sending him out as a missionary brother, and you know that we would never say that if it were not true.
\v 13 There is so much more I would like to share with you, but using a pen and ink is not the best way to do it.
\v 14 I hope to see you soon, and it will be so much better to talk in person.
\p May God give you peace in every circumstance. Your fellow believers here send their greetings to you. Please give our greetings to each one we know there.
