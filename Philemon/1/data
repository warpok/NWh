\v 1 This message is from Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.
\q2 We are writing to Philemon, our dear partner in God's work,
\q3
\v 2 and to to the gathering of believers that meets in your house
\q3 along with our dear sister Apphia,
\q3 and Archippus, the brother who shares in our mission.
\q1
\v 3 May God our Father and the Lord Christ Jesus allow you to enjoy his wonderful kindness and experience his peace in every circumstance.
\p
\v 4 0ver and over again I pray thankfully to our God for you and about you
\v 5 because I keep hearing about the loving and faithful way you serve the Lord Jesus, as shown by the way you help all those whom God has made holy.
\v 6 I pray that the certainty which we possess will increasingly energize you, so that we will increasingly be able to realize the great things we can do together to glorify Christ Jesus.
\v 7 Your acts of love have refreshed the hearts of God's people, bringing to us great encouragement and thanksgiving.
\p
\v 8 Therefore, though as Christ's representative I might speak very freely, and even order you to do what is fitting,
\v 9 I would much rather just ask you to do this based simply on our brotherhood. So here I am, that old man, Paul, currently a prisoner for Christ Jesus,
\v 10 asking this favor of you on behalf of my son, Onesimus. It happens that I have become his father while imprissoned here.
\v 11 I know that previously you might have called him Mr. Useless,\f + \fr 1:11 \fk Mr. Useless … \ft Paul is making a play on words, because the name Onesimus means ‘profitable/useful’.\f* but now, true to his name, he will be of great use to you and to me.
\v 12 I ask you to receive him back, but I admit that sending him to you feels like sending away part of myself.
\v 13 I would have liked to keep him at my side, so that, as your representative, he might continue to help me in my imprisonment for the sake of the Good News.
\v 14 But since you hadn't yet actually sent him to be your representative, it felt like I was forcing you to help me. I don't want to steal help from you, but am happy to receive whatever you send voluntarily.
\v 15 And besides, maybe it was God's will for you two to be separated for a short time, so that now you can enjoy his service from here on.
\p
\v 16 It will be so much better, with him as a productive member of your household, not as a slave, but as a dear brother. He has proved to be that to me, and now he will be even more so to you.
\v 17 So, if we truly have a bond of fellowship between us, receive Onesimus just like you would welcome me into your home.
\v 18 And if he was ever dishonest or owes you money, debit that amount to me.
\v 19 I Paul write this with my own hand: I will reimburse you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me for saving your very soul.)
\v 20 Yes, brother, based on our having such brotherhood because we are both united to the Lord Jesus, I count on you to refresh my heart by doing the favor\f + \fr 1:20 \fk favor \ft Text: ὀναίμην, benefit/profit/favor. Paul is once again making a play on words with 0nesimus’ name.\f* I ask.
\v 21 By writing like this, you can tell that I’m sure that you will do what I have asked, and even more than that.
\v 22 And please also get a guest room ready for me, because I hope that God, in answer to your prayers, will allow me to come again to visit you.
\p
\v 23 Epaphras sends his greetings to you, Philemon. He is my fellow prisoner here for the sake of Christ Jesus.
\v 24 My partners in God's work, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, also send their greetings.
\q1
\v 25 May our Lord Christ Jesus allow each and every one you to enjoy his wonderful kindness, making his presence known in your hearts. Amen
