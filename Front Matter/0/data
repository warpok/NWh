\mt1 Preface to the New Weymouth New Testament in Modern Speech
\ib
\ip This translation is named in admiration of Richard Francis Weymouth, who lived from October 26, 1822 to December 27, 1902. His translation of the New Testament was published posthumously in 1903. I am, however, Philip C. Fields, but please don't call this translation by my name. I aspire to be like R.F. Weymouth in several ways.
\ip Weymouth's translation deserved to be remembered as the first meaning-based translation. I prefer that term to another, namely, dynamic equivalent translation. Weymouth described his translation method in the Preface to the first edition as 1) Ascertain the exact meaning of every passage, and 2) Consider how the meaning could be most accurately and naturally expressed in the English of the present day. In other words, the translators should continually ask, “How would the inspired writer have expressed his thoughts, had he been writing in our age and country.” Following the two steps above will result in a meaning-based translation.
\ip The meaning-based method above starts with finding the meaning of each passage. Note that this is different than finding the meaning of each Greek word, and plugging in an English word with the same meaning. The word-for-word method results in what is termed a literal translation. Literal translations are easy to make, and that is why there are hundreds of them in the English language. Having such long experience with such translations, it amazes me that so many seminary-trained people have not discovered this fact: Difficult passages are always hard to understand in a literal translation. The more woodenly literal a translation of a book like Romans is, the more it results in confusing readers with multiple possible meanings. This is true no matter how brilliant the translator is. It is a much harder task to go past the word level, to the sentence and passage level, to ascertain the meaning intended by the author, and then express it in a thoroughly modern and natural way in the target language.
