\c 15
\p
\v 1 At earliest dawn, after a brief consultation of the whole Jewish High Coucil, including the high priests, the Jewish leaders, and teachers of the Law, they bound Jesus and took him away and handed him over to the Roman governor, Pilate.
\v 2 Pilate asked him. “Are you the king of the Jews?”
\p And Jesus replied, “I am.”
\p
\v 3 Then the high priests heaped one accusation after another on him.
\v 4 Pilate more than once asked Jesus, “Why don't you speak up in your defence? Are you going to let all their charges against you stand without saying a word?”
\p
\v 5 But Jesus made no further answer, and this behavior amazed Pilate.
\v 6 Now each year during the Days for Eating Unleavened Bread it was customary for the governor to pardon and release any one prisoner whom the people requested.
\v 7-8 So it happened on this day a crowd had already assembled to ask Pilate to grant them the usual favour. At this time there were a number of men in prison charged with insurrection and murder. One in particular was named Barabbas.
\v 9 So Pilate asked the crowd, “Well, how about if I release for you the one some say is the rightful king of the Jews?”
\p
\v 10 For Pilate could see that it was out of sheer envy that the high priests had handed Jesus over to him.
\v 11 But the high priests stirred up the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus.
\v 12 But then Pilate again asked them, “Then what do you want me to do to the man you call King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 13 They once more shouted out, “Crucify him!”
\p
\v 14 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.
\p But they even more vehemently shouted, “Crucify him!”
\p
\v 15-16 So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them. He ordered his soldiers to whip Jesus with a whip that tears the skin, and afterward to crucify him. The soldiers led him away into the courtyard of the governor's palace (called the Praetorium). They stripped him and whipped him as ordered, and then assembled the whole regiment,
\v 17 to mock Jesus for being called the king of the Jews. They clothed him in a purple tunic, and wove thorn branches to form a crown, which they placed on his head.
\v 18-19 Then they completed the picture by taking a knee and mockingly saluting him with shouts of “Long live the king of the Jews.” And finally they beat him on the head with a cane and spit on him.
\p
\v 20 At last, when they tired of mocking him, they took the tunic off him, put his own clothes back on him, and led him out to crucify him.
\v 21 Along the way to the crucifixion site, it happened that a man named Simon was passing by on his way into the city. (This Simon was a Cyrenaean, the father of Alexander and Rufus.) The soldiers ordered him to carry Jesus' cross.
\v 22 The crucifixion site was called Golgotha, which in Aramaic means ‘Skull Hill.’
\v 23 Upon arriving there, the soldiers offered him wine mixed with myrrh, to dull the pain, but Jesus refused it.
\v 24-28 Then they nailed him to his cross. This happened at nine in the morning. Over His head they nailed the written notice of the charge against Him. It read, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” And they also crucified two robbers, one at his right hand and one at his left. In this way they unknowingly fulfilled the prophecy written in God's Word which says, ‘He was considered as just another criminal.’ Then the soldiers divided His garments among them, drawing lots to decide what each should take.
\p
\v 29 Passers-by shouted insults at him. Wagging their heads they said, “Ah! You were the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and building a new one in three days.
\v 30 Welll then, it should be easy for you to come down from the cross and save yourself!”
\v 31 In the same way the high priests and the teachers of Jewish law took turns scoffing at Him, saying to one another, “He has saved others. Too bad he can't save himself!
\v 32 So this is the Christ, the King of Israel! He should come down now from the cross while we watch, then we could believe in him.” Even the two men who were being crucified with him repeatedly insulted him.
\p
\v 33 At noon there came a darkness over the whole land, lasting until three in the afternoon.
\v 34 And at three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice in Aramaic, “Elohi, Elohi, lima sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”
\p
\v 35 Some of the bystanders, hearing him misunderstood and said, “Listen, he’s calling for Elijah!”
\v 36 Then a man ran to fill a sponge with sour wine, and he put it on the end of a cane and placed it to his lips, saying at the same time, “Wait! let us see whether Elijah will come and take him down.”
\p
\v 37 But Jesus uttered a loud cry and stopped breathing.
\p
\v 38 At that moment the curtain in the temple\f + \fr 15:38 \fk curtain … \ft There were two curtains in the temple, one at the entrance, and the other separating the holy place from the most holy place. The inner curtain is probably the one which is meant.\f* was torn in two, from top to bottom.
\v 39 And when the Roman company commander who was standing in front of Jesus' cross saw the way he died, he exclaimed, “This man really was the Son of God!”
\p
\v 40 There were also a party of women looking on from a distance. They included Salome,\f + \fr 15:40 \fk Salome \ft This was probably the wife of Zebedee, and the mother of the disciples James and John.\f* Mary from the village of Magdala, and Mary the mother of the younger James and Joses.\f + \fr 15:40 \fk Mary the mother …\ft Many first readers of this Gospel would have realized that the two names listed were Jesus' brothers. See the EVENTUAL footnote at Mat. 27:56.\f*
\v 41 All the party of women, including many not named above, had followed Jesus and provided for him when he was in Galilee, and they were part of the large group who came up with him to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 42 Towards sunset, as it was the day of Preparation— that is, the day preceding the Sabbath—
\v 43 Joseph of Arimathaea came, a highly respected member of the Council, who himself also was living in expectation of the Kingdom of God. He summoned up courage to go in to see Pilate and beg for the body of Jesus.
\v 44 But Pilate could hardly believe that He was already dead. He called, however, for the Centurion and inquired whether He had been long dead;
\v 45 and having ascertained the fact he granted the body to Joseph.
\v 46 He, having bought a sheet of linen, took Him down, wrapped Him in the sheet and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock; after which he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.
\v 47 Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was put.
