\c 12
\p
\v 1 Here is one of the parables Jesus spoke to those leaders:\x + \xo 12:1 \xt Mrk. 11:27\x* “There was once a man who planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, made a stone reservoir for collecting the juice from pressed grapes, and built a watchtower. Then he rented the whole operation to tenant farmers and left the country.
\v 2 Then when it was time for collecting his share of the profits, he sent one of his servants to receive the payment.
\v 3 But they grabbed him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 4 So he sent another servant to them. They wounded this one in the head by throwing stones at him, then yelled insults at him as they sent him back empty-handed.
\v 5 Then the owner sent a third servant, but they killed that one. And he sent many other servants also. The tenents beat some and killed others.
\v 6 Last of all, the owner still had one last person he could send, his only son, whom he loved dearly. So he sent him to them because he was thinking, ‘They will treat my son with respect.’
\v 7 But those tenents said to each other, ‘This guy is the heir! Come on, let’s kill him. Then this property will be ours when the owner dies.’
\v 8 So they seized him, killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard.
\v 9 Now what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do?
\p “He will come and execute those tenents, and will find better tenents to manage his vineyard.
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus challenged them, “How long will it take you to understand this verse which you have certainly read before?— “The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
\v 11 The Lord caused this to happen, and it is amazing and wonderful in our eyes’”\x + \xo 12:11 \xt Ps. 118:22-23\x*
\p
\v 12 At this, the religious leaders left Jesus, but they kept on trying to find a way to arrest him. They clearly understood that Jesus was pointing to them being like the wicked tenents of his parable. However they couldn’t manage to arrest him because they were afraid of upsetting the crowd of people following him.
\p
\v 13 Their next step was to send some members of the Pharisee sect and political supporters of King Herod to try to trick Jesus into saying something that could be used as grounds for having him arrested.
\v 14 They came and asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and you do not defer to any one else’s opinions. In your teaching, you do not take sides, but always impartially and truthfully teach what God wants us to do. So, does our Jewish law allow us to pay taxes to the Roman government, or not?
\v 15 Should we pay, or refuse to pay?”
\p But Jesus, seeing through their hypocrisy, said, “Do you really think you can trap me with a question like that? Show me the coin you use to pay your taxes.”
\v 16 They handed one to him and he asked, “Whose name and face are engraved here?”
\p And they answered, “Caesar’s, the king of Rome.”
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus replied, “That’s correct. So therefore pay to Caesar the coins that he says you owe him, and pay to God what you owe him.” His answer amazed them.
\p
\v 18 The next group sent to test Jesus were members of the Sadducee sect. (Their sect says that after people die, there is no after-life.) They presented their question this way:
\v 19 “Teacher, Moses made it a law for us: ‘If a man’s brother should die and leave a wife, but no child, the man should marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.’
\v 20 Once there were seven brothers. The oldest of whom married, but he died before they had any children.
\v 21 The second married the first brother’s widow, but he also died without leaving an heir. Then the same thing happened with the third,
\v 22 and so forth, until all seven died without leaving an heir. Finally the woman also died.
\v 23 So in the afterlife, whose wife will she be?— for all seven of the brothers married her.”
\p
\v 24 Jesus replied, “Your question demonstrates that your beliefs are wrong. And the reason for your error is that you don’t know God’s written word and you have no concept of the power of God.
\v 25 When people raise up to join the afterlife, they do not marry, just like angels in heaven don’t marry.
\v 26 But about the afterlife, how long will you go on not understanding what Moses wrote in the passage about the bush? God said to Moses, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’
\v 27 God isn’t saying there that he is the God over a bunch of dead men. All those forefathers are living. You have made a huge error.”
\p
\v 28 Then one of the teachers of Jewish law who had listened to the debate with members of the Saduccee sect realized that Jesus had given them a winning answer. He asked Jesus, “Which of Moses’ commandments is the most important to follow?”
\p
\v 29 He replied, “The most important of all the commandments is this: ‘Listen, people of Israel! We worship the one and only Lord, the Lord our God.
\v 30 Love the Lord your God with your whole heart, with all your inner being and mind, and all your strength.’ That is the most important commandment.
\v 31 But there is a second that is next to that one in importance, which is, ‘Love your fellow man just as much as you love yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these two.”
\p
\v 32 Then that man said to Jesus, “Well said, Teacher! It is true that we must worship the one who alone is God,
\v 33 and love him with our whole heart, with all our inner being, mind, and strength. And we must love our fellow man no less than we love ourselves. Those two commands are more important than all the rules about burnt-offerings and other sacrifices.”
\p
\v 34 Recognizing that this man had answered wisely, Jesus said to him, “You are are very close to becoming a citizen of God’s kingdom.”
\p From that time on none of Jesus’ critics ventured to engage him in debate.
\p
\v 35 But while Jesus was still teaching in the temple, he asked, “Why do the teachers of Jewish law say that the prophecied Christ will be a decendant of King David?
\v 36 Because with the leading of the Holy Spirit David himself said, ‘The Lord God said to my Master, “Sit beside me on my right until I have reduced your enemies to be your prisoners.”’
\v 37 So David himself calls the Christ ‘my Master’. If that is so, then why do those teachers say the Christ will be just a decendant of David?”
\p In contrast to Jesus’ critics, the crowd of people listening were delighted with everything he said.
\p
\v 38 While teaching the crowd Jesus said, “Don't be like the teachers of Jewish law. They like to display their status in public places by parading around in long robes, being greeted with respect,
\v 39 and taking the best seats in the synagogues and at dinner parties.
\v 40 Yet it is they who swindle widows out of their property. But then they mask their wickedness by making a show of praying for a long time in the meeting house. God sees these things and will punish them, both for their sinful acts, and for their putting on a show of being good.”
\p
\v 41 Later Jesus sat down in a temple courtyard opposite the offering boxes. He watched the people who were dropping coins into the boxes. Many rich people put in many large coins.
\v 42 Then a poor widow came and dropped in two very small copper coins.
\v 43 At this Jesus called his disciples told them, “Remember this truth: This destitute widow has given a bigger gift than all the others who put in their contributions,
\v 44 because they put in a tiny portion of their wealth. But she, poor as she is, has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”
