\v 1 Here is one of the parables Jesus spoke to those leaders:\x + \xo 12:1 \xt Mrk. 11:27\x* “There was once a man, who planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, made a stone reservoir for collecting the juice from pressed grapes, and built a watchtower. Then he rented the whole operation to tenant farmers and left the country.
\v 2 Then when it was time for collecting his share of the profits, he sent one of his servants to receive the payment.
\v 3 But they grabbed him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 4 So he sent another servant to them. They wounded this one in the head by throwing stones at him, then yelled insults at him as they sent him back empty-handed.
\v 5 Then the owner sent a third servant, but they killed that one. And he sent many other servants also. The tenents beat some and killed others.
\v 6 Last of all, the owner still had one last person he could send, his only son, whom he loved dearly. So he sent him to them because he was thinking, ‘They will treat my son with respect.’
\v 7 But those tenents said to each other, ‘This guy is the heir! Come on, let's kill him. Then this property will be ours when the owner dies.’
\v 8 So they took him and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard.
\v 9 Now what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do?
\p “He will come and execute those tenents, and will find better tenents to manage his vineyard.
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus challenged them, “How long will it take you to understand this verse which you have certainly read before?— “The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
\v 11 The Lord caused this to happen, and it is amazing and wonderful in our eyes’”\x + \xo 12:11 \xt Ps. 118:22-23\x*
\p
\v 12 At this, the religious leaders left Jesus, but they kept on trying to find a way to arrest him. They clearly understood that Jesus was pointing to them being like the wicked tenents of his parable. However they couldn't manage to arrest him because they were afraid of upsetting the crowd of people following him.
\v 13 Their next step was to send some of the Pharisees and political supporters of King Herod to try to trick Jesus into saying something that could be used as grounds for having him arrested.
\v 14 Those men came and asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and you do not defer to any one else's opinions. In your teaching, you do not take sides, but always impartially and truthfully teach what God wants us to do. So, does our Jewish law allow us to pay taxes to the Roman government, or not?
\v 15 Should we pay, or refuse to pay?”
\p But Jesus, seeing through their hypocrisy, said, “Do you really think you can trap me with a question like that? Show me the coin you use to pay your taxes.”
\v 16 They handed one to him and he asked, “Whose name and face are engraved here?"
\p And they answered, “Caesar's, the king of Rome.”
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus replied, “That's correct. So therefore pay to Caesar the coins that he says you owe him, and pay to God what you owe him.” His answer amazed them.
\p
\v 18 The next group sent to test Jesus were members of the Sadducee sect. (Their sect says that after people die, there is no after-life.) They presented their question this way:
\v 19 “Teacher, Moses made it a law for us: ‘If a man's brother should die and leave a wife, but no child, the man should marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.’
\v 20 Once there were seven brothers. The oldest of whom married, but he died before they had any children.
\v 21 The second married the first brother's widow, but he also died without leaving an heir. Then the same thing happened with the third,
\v 22 and so forth, until all seven died without leaving an heir. Finally the woman also died.
\v 23 So in the afterlife, whose wife will she be?— for all seven of the brothers married her.”
\p
\v 24 Jesus replied, “Your question demonstrates that your beliefs are wrong. And the reason for your error is that you don't know God's written word and you have no concept of the power of God.
\v 25 When people raise up to join the afterlife, they do not marry, just like angels in heaven don't marry.
\v 26 But about the afterlife, how long will you go on not understanding what Moses wrote in the passage about the Bush? God said to Moses, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’
\v 27 God isn't saying there that he is the God over a bunch of dead men. All those listed and others are living. Your error is, so to speak, fatal.”
\p
\v 28 Then one of the Scribes, who had heard them disputing and well knew that Jesus had given them an answer to the point, and a forcible one, came forward and asked Him, "Which is the chief of all the Commandments?"
\v 29 "The chief Commandment," replied Jesus, "is this: `Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord;
\v 30 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.'
\v 31 "The second is this: `Thou shalt love thy fellow man as thou lovest thyself.' "Other Commandment greater than these there is none."
\v 32 So the Scribe said to Him, "Rightly, in very truth, Rabbi, have you said that He stands alone, and there is none but He;
\v 33 and To love Him with all one's heart, with all one's understanding, and with all one's strength, and to love one's fellow man no less than oneself, is far better than all our whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices."
\v 34 Perceiving that the Scribe had answered wisely Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." No one from that time forward ventured to put any question to Him.
\p
\v 35 But, while teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, "How is it the Scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?
\v 36 David himself said, taught by the Holy Spirit, "`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I have made thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'
\v 37 "David himself calls Him `Lord:' how then can He be his son?" And the mass of people found pleasure in listening to Jesus.
\v 38 Moreover in the course of His teaching He said, "Be on your guard against the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes and to be bowed to in places of public resort,
\v 39 and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues and at dinner parties,
\v 40 and who swallow up the property of widows and then mask their wickedness by making long prayers: these men will receive far heavier punishment."
\p
\v 41 Having taken a seat opposite the Treasury, He observed how the people were dropping money into the Treasury, and that many of the wealthy threw in large sums.
\v 42 But there came one poor widow and dropped in two farthings, equal in value to a halfpenny.
\v 43 So He called His disciples to Him and said, "In solemn truth I tell you that this widow, poor as she is, has thrown in more than all the other contributors to the Treasury;
\v 44 for they have all contributed out of what they could well spare, but she out of her need has thrown in all she possessed--all she had to live on."
