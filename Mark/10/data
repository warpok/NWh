\v 1 After those events, Jesus left Caperaum and travelled through the region of Judea and even across the Jordan River. 0nce again a huge crowd gathered to be with him, and as usual, he taught them.
\v 2 Then a few members of the Pharisee sect arrived, wanting to test him with a question. Their real purpose was to discredit Jesus if he said something wrong. So they asked him, “Does our Jewish law allow for a man to divorce his wife?"
\p
\v 3 He replied, “What command did Moses write for you in the law?"
\p
\v 4 They said, “Moses permitted a man to a written notice of divorce to his wife, and send her away."\x + \xo 10:4 \xt Duet. 24:1\x*
\p
\v 5 And Jesus replied, “Moses knew how evil and hard hearted you are, and that's why he wrote that law for people like you.
\v 6 But the law from the time of the creation was,
\q1 “God made the first couple of a male and a female."\x + \xo 10:6 \xt Gen. 1:27; 5:1-2\x*
\q1
\v 7 For this reason, in marriage a man is to leave his father and mother and be united with his wife.
\q2
\v 8 From that time on, the husband and wife should no longer be thought of as two people, but as a unity.\f + \fr 10:8 \fk unity \ft Both the Hebrew of Gen. 2:24 and the Greek of this verse literally say ‘one flesh'. This is like what Adam says in Gen. 2:23, that Eve is “bone from his bone and flesh from his flesh.” In the Old Testament, ‘one flesh' becomes an idiom that describes unity of kin or even political unity. So the idea of ‘one flesh' does not just mean sexual union.\f*
\m
\v 9 So therefore, what God has so unified should not be separated by anyone."
\p
\v 10 Indoors the disciples began asking Jesus again on the same subject.
\v 11 He replied, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman, commits adultery against the first wife.
\v 12 And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."
\p
\v 13 One day parents were bringing their young children for Jesus to touch and bless them, but the disciples began telling the parents to stop bothering Jesus.
\v 14 This made Jesus angry. He told the disciples, “Let the little ones come to me. Don't try to stop them, because the kingdom of God is open to people who simply come like these children.
\v 15 Remember this truth: Trustingly coming, like a little child does, is the only way to enter the kingdom of God."
\v 16 Then he embraced the children and, placing his hands on their heads, prayed for God to bless each one.
\p
\v 17 As Jesus went out to resume his journey, a man came running to him, hurriedly knelt before him, and asked, “Good teacher, what must I do to guarantee that I will be given eternal life?"
\p
\v 18 Then Jesus replied, “Why do you call me good? There is no one truly good except One, that is, God.
\v 19 You know the commandments:
\li1 Do not murder.
\li1 Do not commit adultery.
\li1 Do not steal.
\li1 Do not defraud.
\li1 Do not lie when testifying in court.
\li1 Honour your father and your mother."
\p
\v 20 And the man answered, “Teacher, I have carefully followed all those commandments ever since I was a boy."
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus looked at him with concern and love, and said, “There is only one thing you still need to do: Go, sell everything you own and give the proceeds to the poor. God will give you riches in heaven. Then come back to become one of my followers, having made the commitment to follow me no matter what, even if it means dying on a cross."
\p
\v 22 As soon as the man heard Jesus' answer, his face showed his disappointment. He went away dejected, because he was very wealthy.
\v 23 Then looking around at his disciples Jesus said, “Becoming a citizen in God's kingdom is so very difficult for those who are rich!"
\v 24 This statement amazed them. So Jesus clarified, “Children, becoming a citizen in God's heavenly kingdom is almost impossible for those who rely on their physical wealth.
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter God's kingdom."
\p
\v 26 Now they were even more overcome with amazement and said to one another, “Wow! If even people God blesses with wealth are unlikely to enter into God's heavenly kingdom, what chance do any of us have?"
\p
\v 27 Gazing at them Jesus said, “This is one of the things that human power can't accomplish, but God can. No obstacle can stop God."
\p
\v 28 Then Peter said, “But then what about us? We've already left everything behind to follow you."
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered, “Remember this truth: Without exception, anyone who has left behind his house, fields, brothers, sisters, father, mother, or children, for my sake and for the sake of the spreading the God's Good News
\v 30 will receive a hundred times as much now in this present life, houses, fields, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, (plus mix in some inevitable persecution). Then after that, in the coming age, they will receive eternal life in God's kingdom.
\v 31 But many people who are thought to be most important now, will be least important then. And those now thought to be of no importance will become the very most important."
\p
\v 32 Jesus stopped to tell the twelve disciples what was going to happen to him while he was leading them on the road going up to Jerusalem. Given the situation, they were amazed that they were even making this journey. Though they were still following him, they were afraid. He told them,
\v 33 “Here's what will happen to me in Jerusalem. I, the the prophecied Son of Adam, will be betrayed to the high priests and the teachers of Jewish law. They will condemn me to death, and will hand me over to the non-Jewish leaders.
\v 34 They, in their turn, will mock me, beat me with whips, spit on me, and kill me. But on the third day I will come back alive."
\p
\v 35 One day James and John, the sons of Zebedee, brought this request to Jesus, “Teacher, we hope that you will do us a favor."
\p
\v 36 So he replied, “And what would that be?"
\p
\v 37 And they replied, “Please allow the two of us to sit right next to you, one of us on each side, when you sit on your glorious throne."
\p
\v 38 But then Jesus said, “You have no idea what you're asking. Do you think you will be able to endure the same bitter suffering that I must endure? Will you be able to endure the same angguish that must come upon me?"
\p
\v 39 “Yes, they answered, “we are able."
\p And he replied, “As a matter of fact, you both will endure the same suffering and agguish that I will,
\v 40 but as for sitting right next to me when I sit on that throne, that favor is not mine to grant. Those seats have already been reserved for others."
\p
\v 41 Somehow the other ten disciples heard about James and John's request, and this made them indignant against them.
\v 42 Jesus, however, called for them gather around and said to them all, “As everyone knows, those who are considered rulers in the world lord it over their people. No one wants to get on their wrong side, or they will be punished.
\v 43 But this is not the way it will work among you. Instead, the top leader among you must take the lowest position, serving all the rest.
\v 44 If you want to be number one, you must become the slave who serves all the rest.
\v 45 Follow me, for I, the Son of Adam, also did not come to be served upon, but to serve others, and to give my life as the redemption-price for many."
\p
\v 46 The party of travelers reached Jericho. Then as Jesus, his disciples, and a whole crowd of others were leaving that city, a blind beggar name Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting by the road.
\v 47 Hearing that Jesus the Nazarene was in the crowd, he began to shout, “Jesus, the Son of David, take pity on me!"
\v 48 Many angrily told him to shut up, but he only got more insistent in shouting, “Oh, Son of David, please have mercy on me!"
\p
\v 49 Jesus stopped walking and said, “Tell him to come here."
\p So they told Bartimaeus, “Cheer up! Get up. He's said for you to come."
\v 50 Bartimaeus flung his tunic away as he sprang to his feet, and was quickly led to Jesus.
\v 51 “What do you want me to do for you?" said Jesus.
\p “Oh Teacher please," he replied, “I want to be able to see again."
\p
\v 52 Jesus said, “It is because you fully believe in me that your eyes are now healed." Instantly he regained his sight, and followed Jesus along the road.
