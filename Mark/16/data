\c 16
\p
\v 1-2 The moment Sabbath was over, soon after sunrise on the first day of the week, the two Marys and Salome bought spices to the tomb, in order to anoint Jesus' body.
\v 3 They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb for us ?”
\v 4 The stone was immense. But as they approached and looked up, they saw that the stone was already rolled aside.
\v 5 When they entered the tomb, they were started and alarmed to see a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting to their right.
\v 6 But he said to them, “Don't be alarmed. You're looking for Jesus, the Nazarene who was crucified. He is not here. He’s come back to life. This is the place where they laid him.
\v 7 But go and tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. That's where you will see him, just as he told you.”
\v 8 Overwhelmed and trembling, the women fled from the tomb. They didn't tell anyone, because they were so afraid.
\p
\v 9 After Jesus came back to life early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to the Mary that was from the village of Magdala. (Jesus had previously banished seven demons from her.)
\v 10 She went and told the news to the group who had been with him, those who were together mourning and weeping.
\v 11 But when they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they didn’t believe it.
\p
\v 12 After this, he showed himself to two of who had heard the news that Mary brought. They on their way into the countryside, and Jesus appeared in a different form.
\v 13 When they recognized him, they went back and told the news to the rest. But the others didn't believe them either.
\p
\v 14 After that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating, and he scolded them for so bone-headidly refusing to believe those who had seen Him alive.
\v 15 Then he said to them, “Go the whole world over and proclaim the Good News to all mankind.
\v 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever refuses to believe will be condemned.
\v 17 Miraculous signs such as these will accompany the believers who spread of the Good News:
\li1 They will banish demons through claiming the authority of my name.
\li1 They shall speak in languages they previously didn't know.
\li1
\v 18 Even if they pick up venomous snakes or drink a deadly poison, they will not be harmed.\x + \xo 16:18 \xt Luk. 10:19\x*
\li1 And people who are sick will recover after believers lay their hands on them.”
\p
\v 19 After the Lord finished speaking to his disciples, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
\v 20 Then they went out and proclaimed the Good News everywhere. The Lord continues working along side the believers by confirming their message with the miraculous signs he gives them.
