\v 1 After some days He came back to Capernaum, and soon everyone heard that He had come home,
\v 2 and right away people flocked to the place where he was, so many that there was no room for anyone to approach the door. While he was teaching them,
\v 3 four men came carrying a paralyzed man on a bed.
\v 4 Finding no way to get near to Jesus, they took him up the stairs to the flat roof, and after removing some panels of the roof right above where Jesus was sitting, they lowered the bed on which the man was lying.
\v 5 Jesus clearly perceived that these men fully believed that he was able to heal the man. Jesus looked at him and said, “My son, your sins have been forgiven by me."
\v 6 Now there were some teachers of religious law sitting there who were thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “How does this guy\f + \fr 2:7 \fk this guy \ft | Text: οὗτος (demonstrative pronoun nominative singular male), this one. This pronoun is often used to show contempt.\f* dare to talk like this? Only God can forgive someone's sins. By making out that he can do that, he is insulting God!"
\v 8 But Jesus was immediately aware of their critical thoughts. He responded, “What's up with the way you are silently criticizing me?
\v 9 You're not finding a basis for my telling this man, ‘Your sins have already been forgiven by me.' Well how about if I tell him, `‘Get up and take your bed home'?
\v 10 So now, in order that you can recognize me as the prophesied Son of Adam, and know that I have authority here on earth to forgive sins"— then turning to the man on the bed he said,
\v 11 “Now I'm telling you, ‘Get up and take your bed home.'"
\v 12 Suddenly, while everyone watched, the man got up and did just what Jesus told him to do. They were all amazed and praised God, commenting to each other, “We've never seen anything like this!"
\p
\v 13 Again Jesus went out beside the lake and taught the crowds that were coming to Him.
\v 14 And as he walked along, he saw a tax collector named Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting near his office, and Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And Levi did so.
\v 15 Later, Jesus and His disciples were invited to a meal at Levi's house, where a large number of tax collectors and other notorious sinners\f + \fr 2:15 \fk other … \ft The Jews who collected taxes for the Roman government were considered to be betraying their own people for profit. They were therefore regarded as belonging to the category of notorious sinners.\f* were also seated around the table. Many such people with bad reputations who followed Jesus.
\v 16 But when the teachers of religious law and members of the Pharisee sect saw Him eating with the the tax collectors and sinners they said to His disciples, “Look at him, eating with such scum!"
\v 17 Hearing their talk, Jesus said, “It's not the healthy people who need a doctor, but the sick. I didn't come to call people who think they're good enough, but to call sinners to repent."
\p
\v 18 Now it happened that John's disciples were observing a religious fast, and members of the Pharisee sect were doing the same. So some people came to ask Jesus, “How come both John's disciples do religious fasting, and the Pharisee sect, but yours do not?"
\v 19 Jesus answered, “Let's draw an analogy with a wedding reception. While all the guests are celebrating with the bridegroom, do you expect them to suddenly get all sad and stop eating? Doesn't sound very likely, does it?
\v 20 But a day will come when the bridegroom will be arrested and led away. That's when they will sorrowfully stop eating."
\v 21 Then Jesus gave two word pictures, “Think of what's appropriate. If you have a big hole in an old shirt, you won't use new and unshrunken cloth to mend it. The next time you would wash that shirt, the new cloth would shrink and pull away from the old cloth, making an even bigger hole.
\v 22 Similarly, you wouldn't pour new wine into old wineskins, right? The ballooning gas given off by the new wine would burst the old wineskins. The wine would spill out and the wineskins would no longer be useful for anything. New wine needs fresh wineskins!"
\p
\v 23 There was a Sabbath day when Jesus and his disciples were walking through a couple of wheatfields. The disciples picked a few heads of wheat in passing to chew on.
\v 24 Some of the members of the Pharisee sect walking with them complained to Jesus, “Look! Your disciples are breaking the Sabbath laws by doing that."
\p
\v 25 Answering them he said, “You seem to have forgotton what David did in that difficult time when he and his men were hungry.
\v 26 This was in the days of Abiathar, who became the high priest. David got loaves of sacred bread from God's house, which according to the Law only priests are allowed to eat. Nevertheless he not only ate from them, but gave some to his men.
\v 27 The weekly Sabbath observance was made to help all the children of Adam. People were not created to be slaves of the Sabbath.
\v 28 So also I— as the prophesied Son of Adam— am master over the Sabbath."
