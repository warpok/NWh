\c 4
\p
\v 1 Once more He began to teach by the lake, and a huge crowd gathered to listen to him. So he got into a boat and sat there, a little way from the shore, where all the people were.
\v 2 Then he proceeded to teach them many lessons in the form of parables such as this one:
\pi1
\v 3 “Pay attention! A farmer went out to scatter some seed in a field.
\v 4 On the way, some of the seed fell along the path, and the birds came right away and devoured it.
\pi1
\v 5 Some seed fell on a rocky place, where only a thin layer of soil covered the rocks. The sprouts were soon visible, because new growth could only grow upward.
\v 6 But the heat of the sun scorched the sprouts. They withered away because their roots could find no water.
\pi1
\v 7 Some, again, fell in a place where thorny plants were springing up. The thorny plants completely crowded out the shoots of grain, so that they yielded nothing.
\pi1
\v 8 But some seed also fell on good ground, where it grew tall and produced a good crop. Some single stalks bore thirty, sixty, or even a hundred grains.”
\v 9 Jesus then said, “Don’t let this teaching go in one ear and out the other!”
\p
\v 10 When He was alone, the twelve and others who were gathered around asked Him to explain what this parable meant.
\v 11 He replied, “Previously God didn’t reveal much information about the coming of His Kingdom to earth. But now you have been given permission to learn previously secret truth. But for those outside your number, I will continue to reveal those insights using parables.
\v 12 So this will turn out as God said,
\q1 ‘Let them be forever listening to the Lord’s messages, but never understanding them,
\q2 and forever witnessing his deeds, but never learning anything from them.
\q3 Let them keep on going like that without coming back to me, because then I would forgive them.’\x + \xo 4:12 \xt Is. 6:9-10\x*
\p
\v 13 “Did all of you miss the meaning of that parable? If you can’t understand an easy one like that, you’ll be hopeless at figuring out my other parables!”
\pi1
\v 14 “The seed that the farmer was scattering is God’s message.
\v 15 First, the seeds that fell along the path, picture those those who hear the message, but Satan quickly comes and steals it from them.
\pi1
\v 16 Second, the seeds that fell on a rocky place, picture those who immediately receive the message with joy.
\v 17 But because of their shallowness, the message cannot penetrate deeply in them and is remembered only a short time. As soon as the message causes any suffering or persecution, they immediately wither away.
\pi1
\v 18 Third, the seeds that fell in a place where thorny plants were springing up picture those who have heard the message,
\v 19 but thorns in the shape of worldly cares, and being tricked by get-rich-quick schemes, and the excessive pursuit of other objects completely crowd out the message. The little shoots of grain never get a chance to bear fruit.
\pi1
\v 20 Finally, there were seeds that fell on good ground, which picture all who hear the message and welcome it, and they become like single stalks that bear thirty, sixty, or even a hundred grains.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus went on to say, “When you bring a lamp into a dark room, what do you do with it? Do you cover it up with a pot or put it under a bed, or do you put it where the light will brighten the room?
\v 22 So take some time in understanding my parables. Things that seem hidden will ultimately be disclosed. Sooner or later the secrets that seems shrouded in darkness will dawn on you.
\v 23 Don’t let this teaching go in one ear and out the other!”
\p
\v 24 He also said to them, “Think about what I am teaching you. TIhe more you seek to understand it, the more understanding God will give you, and he will give added insight to you who listen carefully.
\v 25 Those who gain insight will be given more. And those who don’t bother to gain understanding will eventually find themselves robbed of the power to comprehend anything at all.”
\p
\v 26 Here is another of Jesus’ parables: “The reign of God as king over this world can be compared to a farmer who scattered seed in a field.
\v 27 The farmer then goes about life as normal, sleeping at night and working by day. Without his taking an active role, the seed sprouts and grows tall.
\v 28 The natural process happens in the soil, with the seed producing a shoot, then the head, and finally the ripened grain.
\v 29 When the grain is ripe, the farmer immediately takes action. Harvest time has come, and he sends out men with sharp sickles to do the work.”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus said, “Let me draw another analogy to describe the reign of God as king over this world.
\v 31 It is like a mustard seed. Even though it is one of the smallest seeds in the world,
\v 32 yet when it falls to the ground, it springs up and becomes larger than all the other plants in your garden. Its branches grow so big that birds can find shelter among them.”
\p
\v 33 Jesus used many such parables to teach his message, because this enabled his listeners to remember his words and gain understanding.
\v 34 So he kept on always using many parables in his teaching, but he would explain everything to his disciples in private.
\p
\v 35 At evening of the same day, he said to them, “Let’s cross to the other side.”
\v 36 So all those with Jesus in the boat sailed away with him, leaving behind the crowd on the shore. There were also a few other boats which also sailed away following them.
\v 37 But a huge swirling storm engulfed them, making waves pour into the boat, so much so that it was in danger of sinking.
\v 38 But Jesus was in the stern asleep, with His head on a cushion. So they shook him awake, telling him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re all gonna die?”
\p
\v 39
\p So he roused himself and commanded the wind and the waves, “Stop! Be still!” The wind sank, and a perfect calm set in.
\v 40 Then he said to them, “What were you so afraid of? What happened to the idea of your trusting me?”
\p
\v 41 They were totally awestruck and terrified, saying to each other, “What kind of man is he? Even the wind and waves obey Him.”
