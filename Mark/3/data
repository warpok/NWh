\v 1 On another Sabbath day, when Jesus went to a Jewish meeting house, a man was there with a deformed and paralyzed arm.
\v 2 There were members of the Pharisee\f + \fr 3:2 \fk members … \ft Text: παρετήρουν, they watched closely. This is evidently the same actors as found at the end of chapter 2.\f* sect there who were closely watching him to see whether he would cure that man on the Sabbath day, so as to have a charge to bring against Jesus.
\v 3 Speaking to that man, he said, “Please stand up here."
\v 4 Then Jesus asked them, “What does our law allow for us to do on the Sabbath day? Can we do a good deed? 0r is it OK to do something harmful? Would it be lawful to save someone's life, or to kill someone?" No one answered.
\v 5 He looked around, grieved and indignant that no one thought it would be a good idea to help someone. Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your arm." The man found that he was able to do so, because the arm was completely restored, just like the other one.
\v 6 But as soon as those Pharisees left the meeting house they met with political supporters of King Herod to devise a way to kill Jesus.
\p
\v 7 After that, Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a vast crowd followed him from the provinces of Galilee and Judea.
\v 8 People came from Jerusalem, and even from the region of Idumaea in the south, from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon. All these people came because they heard what he was doing.
\v 9-10 He had cured many of them already, so all the others who had ailments were trying to get close enough to touch Him. So he told his disciples to keep a boat near him because of the throng, to prevent their crushing him.
\v 11 People under the control of evil spirits were falling prostrate before him and shrieking, “You are the Son of God!"
\v 12 But many a time he silenced them, forbidding them to say who he was.
\p
\v 13 After that, he went up a hill and called the men he had personally chosen, and they came to him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve of them to be his closest followers. This was with a view of sending them out to announce his message,
\v 15 while being empowered by him to cure diseases and banish demons.
\v 16 He appointed Simon (whom he renamed Peter),
\v 17 James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James. (These two He nicknamed Boanerges, which means `Sons of Thunder').
\v 18 Also he appointed Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite,
\v 19 and Judas from Cariot,\f + \fr 3:19 \fk from Cariot \ft Text: Ἰσκαριώτην, Iscariot. This was probably not a second name of Judas, but more likely describes him as being from the village of Cariot.\f* the man who also betrayed Him.
\p Then Jesus returned from that place and went into a house.
\v 20 But there were so many people crowding around that he and the disciples had no time even to grab a bite of bread.
\v 21 Some people told his family what was happening. Fearing that he had gone insane, they started out\f + \fr 3:21 \fk started out \ft The distance from Nazareth to Capernaum is 40 miles.\f* to take control of him.
\v 22 Perhaps those people who spoke to Jesus' family were influenced by some teachers of Jewish law who had come from Jerusalem. They were saying, “He's being controlled by Baal Zebul.\f + \fr 3:22 \fk Baal Zebul \ft Text: Βεελζεβοὺλ. The spelling chosen here helps readers relate this demon's name to the Old Testament idol, whose name in Hebrew means God the Prince. The writer of 2Kings 1:2 intentionally misspells that name as Baal Zebub, which means God of flies.\f* The Prince of demons gives him the power to banish other demons."
\p
\v 23 So Jesus called the crowd to gather around and told them, “There's no way Satan is going to make war with himself.” Then Jesus gave these illustrations:
\v 24 A nation that is seriously divided into warring factions will collapse.
\v 25 And how little hope there is for a family that starts feuding.
\v 26 So if various princes in Satan's kingdom are at war with each other, his kingdom will totally break apart.
\v 27 Something like that is not happening. Satan is like a strong man constantly guarding the wealth in his house. His wealth is secure until someone stronger than him appears, binds him, and then plunders his wealth.
\v 28 I underline this truth: God is ready to forgive all kinds of sins that people commit, including the insults they have uttered against him.
\v 29 However whoever insults the Holy Spirit puts himself in a position where he may never ever be forgiven, but is in danger eternal punishment."\f + \fr 3:29 \fk he may never … \ft This verse is translated with the understanding that the Greek text does not specifically say that a person who insults the Holy Spirit can never repent and ask for forgiveness. Rather, it is simply unlikely that a person in this frame of mind will ever repent.\f*
\v 30 Jesus gave this teaching to warn his critics, because they were saying, “He's being controlled by an evil spirit."
\p
\v 31-32 Some time later, Jesus was in a house with a crowd all around him when his mother and brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent a message inside about wanting to see him. So someone told him, “Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside wanting to talk with you."
\v 33 He replied, “Let me introduce you to my mother and my brothers."
\v 34 Looking around at those sitting around Him He said, “These people right here are my mother and my brothers.
\v 35 For anyone who habitually does what pleases God is my brother, or my sister, or my mother."
