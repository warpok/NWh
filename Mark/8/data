\v 1 About that time another immense crowd gathered, and they found themselves with nothing to eat. So Jesus called his disciples and said,
\v 2 “My heart goes out for these people, because this is the third day they have stayed here with me, and now they have nothing to eat.
\v 3 Some of them have a long way to walk to get back home. If I send them off without first eating something, they’ll pass out on the way.”
\p
\v 4 His disciples replied, “Out in a remote place like this, where could we possibly get enough bread to satisfy this crowd?”
\p
\v 5 Then he asked, “How many pieces of bread do you have?”
\p “Seven,” they said.
\p
\v 6 So he gave the order that everybody should sit down on the ground. Then taking the seven pieces, he gave thanks to God for them, broke them into portions, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd.
\v 7 They had also a few small fish. He blessed them, and told the disciples to distribute these also.
\v 8 Everyone ate until they were satisfied. Then the leftovers were collected and filled seven large baskets.
\v 9 The number fed were about 4,000. Then Jesus said goodbye and sent them home.
\p
\v 10 Then right after that, he and his disciples went by boat to the region of Dalmanutha.\f + \fr 8:10 \fk Dalmanutha \ft The location of this area or village is now unknown.\f*
\v 11 Some members of the Pharisee sect arrived there and began to debate with Jesus, and they were also testing him by demanding he make something miraculous happen in the sky.
\v 12 Breathing out a deep sigh of disappointment he said, “How wrong it is for people like you to demand that I make a miracle! I solemnly promise that I will never make any miracles for people like you to see.”
\p
\v 13 So getting back in the boat, he left them, and crossed to the other side of the lake.
\v 14 Now the disciples had forgotten to buy bread. They only had one piece of bread with them in the boat.
\v 15 So they misunderstood when he gave them this stern warning, “Watch out that you do not get infected with the yeast of the Pharisee sect. Avoid also the yeast of King Herod’s party.”
\v 16 In trying to figure out what Jesus meant, they landed on the idea that they had forgotten to get bread.
\v 17 He knew how badly they had missed his point, so he said to them, “Come on now! There’s no need to talk about bread. Wake up! Use your minds. How can you be so clueless?
\v 18 Where have you misplaced your eyes and ears? Can you no longer remember anything?
\v 19 When I broke the five pieces of bread into portions for the 5,000 men, how many baskets of leftovers did you collect?”
\p “Twelve,” they said.
\p
\v 20 “And when I made portions from seven pieces for the 4,000, how many large baskets did you fill?”
\p “Seven,” they answered.
\p
\v 21 And he said, “So now, do you still not understand?”\x + \xo 8:21 \xt Mat. 16:12\x*
\p
\v 22 When Jesus arrived at Bethsaida, a blind man was brought to Jesus and they begged him to heal his eyes by touching him.
\v 23 Jesus took hold of the man’s arm and guided him out of the village, then he applied his own spit onto the man’s eyes, and also touched them. Then he asked him, “Can you see anything?”
\v 24 The man looked around and said, “I can see people over there, but they look like short trees walking around.”
\v 25 Then for second time Jesus touched his eyes and told him to look around. This time the man fully recovered his sight, seeing everything clearly.
\v 26 Then Jesus sent him home, telling him, “Do not even go by way of the village, and don’t tell anyone in the village about what just happened.”
\p
\v 27 Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went from village to village in the region of Caesarea Philippi. On the way He began to ask His disciples, “What do people think about me? Who do I remind them of?”
\p
\v 28 They answered, “Some say that you are the return of the baptizer, the Prophet John. Others say that you are like the Prophjet Elijah. Still others are saying that you are like one of the other prophets.”
\p
\v 29 But he asked them, “But what do you yourselves say about me?”
\p It was Peter who answered, “You are the annointed one, the Christ.”\f + \fr 8:29 \fk the annointed … \ft Text: ὁ Χριστός, the Christ. For clarity, the meaning of the title ‘Christ’ is made explicit, since so many readers only understand the title as a name for Jesus.\f*
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus strictly forbid them from telling this information to anyone else.
\v 31 But then for the first time he began to teach them, “I, as the prophesied Son of Adam, must endure much suffering. I will be rejected by the elder leaders of the Jews, the high priests, and the teachers of Jewish law, and then I will be murdered. But on the third day I will come back alive.”
\v 32 He very plainly told them this news. This moved Peter to take him aside, where he started to tell him he shouldn’t be saying such things.
\v 33 But Jesus turned around to catch the eye of his other disciples, and told him off, “Peter, you go back to last place in line. You are being like Satan, opposing God’s will and trying to tempt me with human ideas.”
\p
\v 34 Then he called out to the crowd to gather around with his disciples, and he said to them, “If you want to be my follower, you must stop thinking about all the things you want, and instead follow me with this resolve, ‘I won’t give up, even if it means dying on a cross.’
\v 35 For whoever is determined to save his own life will lose it, but anyone who loses his life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, will save it.
\v 36 Consider this: Suppose you were able to gain control of all the wealth of the world, but then you die, what would you have gained from all that wealth?
\v 37 After all, no matter how much wealth you have, it won’t be enough to buy back your life.
\v 38 Now, in this age when people are so sinful and keep changing sides, if you are too ashamed to confess, ‘I am a follower of Jesus and his teachings,’ then when I, the Son of Adam, come back in the radiance of my Father’s presence and with his angels, I will say about you, ‘He is not my follower.’”
