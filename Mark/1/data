\v 1-2 This is the Good News about Christ Jesus, the Son of God. It starts just like the prophets revealed about what God said to his Son,
\mi “Note this: I am sending my messenger to prepare the people for your coming."\x + \xo 1:2 \xt Mal. 3:1\x*
\mi
\v 3 “This message will be proclaimed in the wilderness, ‘Let's get ourselves ready for the Lord's coming! Remove all obstacles for him to rule over us!’”\x + \xo 1:3 \xt Is. 40:3 LXX\x*
\p
\v 4 Hundreds of years later, the man God mentioned came to the wilderness. His name was John. He taught the people who came to him, “You must repent of your sins so that God will forgive you. And to show that you want to be faithful to God, come to me and I will baptize you.”
\v 5 People came out in droves from all parts of the province of Judea and from Jerusalem. They openly confessed their sins to God, and John baptized them.
\v 6 John looked like a prophet because his clothes were made of camel's hair and he wore a leather belt. He usually ate food he found in the wilderness, including locusts and honey.
\v 7 He repeatedly proclaimed to the people, “It won't be long before Another will come. He will be way more powerful than me, so much so that I am not worthy to do the most menial task for Him.
\v 8 I can only baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
\p
\v 9 It was in those days of John's ministry that Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee and was baptized by him in the Jordan river.
\v 10 Even as Jesus was still coming up out of the river, he saw a sudden split in the heavens,\f + \fr 1:10 \fk heavens \ft | Text: οὐρανούς, heavens (plural). From the first verse of Genesis and in many other places, we see that the writers of Scripture believed in multiple layers of the heavens. The sky was the lowest layer, and God's dwelling is the top-most layer. \f* and the Holy Spirit came fluttering down like a dove to him.
\v 11 Then God spoke from the heavens, “You are Son and I love you so dearly. I delight in you."
\p
\v 12 And immediately the Holy Spirit compelled Jesus to go out into the wilderness.
\v 13He stayed out there for forty days, in a place where there were many wild animals. Over and over again Satan tempted him to do wrong, but there were also times when angels took care of him.
\p
\v 14 Some time later, after John had been thrown into prison, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming Good News about God ruling the world.
\v 15 He was telling everyone, “The waiting is over! God will soon be reigning here as king. You must repent and believe this Good News.”
\p
\v 16 One day, as he was walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee, he saw two fishermen throwing their nets in the Lake. They were the brothers, Simon and Andrew. (Simon is the one we normally refer to as Peter.)
\v 17 “Come and follow me," he said. “I will teach you to catch people, instead of fish."
\v 18 And right away they left their nets and followed him.
\v 19 Walking on a little further Jesus saw two other fishermen sitting in their boat and mending their nets. They were sons of Zebedee, James and John.
\v 20 He quickly called them also, and they followed him, leaving their father and his hired men in the boat.
\p
\v 21 After that, they went to the town of Capernaum. 0n the Sabbath day he went to the Jewish meeting house and began teaching those who had gathered there.
\v 22 They listened with amazement to his teaching, because he taught like a ruler who had the right to command obedience. His teaching was very different from what they heard from the teachers of Jewish law.
\p
\v 23 It happened that a man was there who was under the control of an evil spirit. He screamed out,
\v 24 “Hey you! Jesus from Nazareth. You have no business coming here! Or do you plan to destroy us? I know who you are: The holy One sent by God."
\v 25 But Jesus lashed out, “Silence! Come out of him."
\v 26 The evil spirit threw the man into a convulsion, and finally came out of him with a shriek.
\v 27 Everyone there was completely amazed, so when they found their tongues they said to each other, “What does this mean? Here is a new kind of teaching that comes with such authority! When he commands, even the evil spirits obey!"
\v 28 Such news about him spread quickly everywhere in the whole province all of Galilee.
\p
\v 29 Right after Jesus and his four followers left the meeting house, they went to Peter\f + \fr 1:29 \fk Peter \ft Text: Simon. Since this Simon is so much more recognizably known by his other name, this translation will usually refer to him as Peter. See Jn. 1:40-42.\f* and Andrew's home.
\v 30 It happened that Peter's mother-in-law was in bed suffering with a high fever, and without delay someone told Jesus about her.
\v 31 So he came and took her by the hand, and helped her to sit up. Immediately the fever left her, and she began to serve them the food that she had prepared the day before.
\v 32 Just after sunset that evening when the Sabbath was over, people came to him bringing everyone who was sick and others who were controlled by demons.
\v 33 It seemed that the whole town was milling around the door.
\v 34 Jesus healed every kind of Illness among that crowd, and he banished many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak. They knew who he was alright, but he wouldn't let demons speak.
\p
\v 35 Jesus got up and left the house before daybreak the next morning, going away to a place where he could be alone to pray.
\v 36 When Peter realized that Jesus wasn't there, he and some others went out to search for him.
\v 37 When they found him they said, “Let's go back, because everyone is looking for you."
\v 38 But Jesus answered, “No. Let's be on our way to the next villages and towns, so I can preach there also, because that is what God sent me to do."
\v 39 Then he went through all the province of Galilee, preaching in Jewish meeting houses and banishing demons that were controlling people.
\p
\v 40 One day a man with a contageous skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down to make his request, “If you want to, I know you are able to heal me from this disease."
\v 41 Moved with pity, Jesus reached out and touched him, replying, “I want to. Be healed."
\v 42 All at once the man's skin disease disappeared, leaving him totally cured.
\v 43 Jesus at once sent him away with a stern warning,
\v 44 “Do as I say: Don't tell anyone about this. Instead, go first to show yourself to one of the priests. Then present the offerings that Moses commanded for anyone who is cured from a skin disease.\x + \xo 1:44 \xt Lev. 14:1-32\x* Then everyone will know that you truly have been healed."
\v 45 But instead of doing what Jesus said, the man went out and began telling everyone everywhere. The result of this was that it was no longer practical for Jesus to go openly into any town. So he and his disciples stayed out in remote places, and there was a steady stream of people coming from everywhere to meet him.
