\v 1 So they arrived at the opposite shore of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes.
\v 2 As Jesus was getting out of the boat, he was immediately accosted by a man who was under the control of an evil spirit.\f + \fr 5:2 \fk evil spirit \ft Text: πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ, unclean spirit. This story also uses the word δαίμονες, demons. There is no difference between the two. Demons are fallen angels who prior to the creation of the world followed Satan in rebelling against God.\f* He had come out from the burial caves that were near the shore there.
\v 3-4 In fact, he lived among those caves. Although people repeatedly tried, no one could get control over him. He always managed to escape even when bound hand and foot with chains. He tore apart the chains on his hands, and he smashed the chains on his feet until they lay shattered. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
\v 5 So finally he stayed day and night among the burial caves that were in those hills, shrieking, and cutting himself with sharp stones.
\v 6-8 When he saw Jesus from some distance away, he started running toward him, and Jesus called out several times, “You evil spirit, come out of that man.” When the man got close to Jesus, he threw himself down before him and shouted, “Jesus, Son of God in the highest heaven, we have nothing in common. In God’s name I beg you not to torture me!”
\p
\v 9 Jesus asked him. “What’s your name?”
\p Then one of the demons controlling the man answered, “Batallion, because we who control him are so many.”
\v 10 Then they repeatedly begged Jesus to not send them out of that region.
\p
\v 11 Feeding there on the hillside was a huge herd of pigs.
\v 12 So the demons begged Jesus, “Just give us permission to go into those pigs over there.”
\v 13 He quickly agreed, and the evil spirits came out and went into the swine, and the whole herd—about 2,000 in number—rushed headlong down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.
\p
\v 14 The herdsmen fled and spread the news in the town and countryside. Then many people came out to see what had happened.
\v 15 When they came to where Jesus was, they saw that the man formerly controlled by a batallion of demons was sitting near him, fully clothed and completely sane. The crowd’s first reaction was fear.
\v 16 Those who had seen what happened to the formerly demon-controlled man and the pigs told everybody about it.
\v 17 Then the crowd began begging Jesus to leave their region.
\p
\v 18 Just as he was about to get into the boat, the man who had been freed from demons began asking him, “Oh please, can I come with you?”
\v 19 But instead of saying Yes, Jesus said, “No. Go home to your family and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and the mercy He has shown you.”
\v 20 So the man did so, and even more, proclaiming all over the province of Ten Towns how much Jesus had done for him. Everyone was amazed.
\p
\v 21 When Jesus and his disciples had returned to the other side in that boat, a huge crowd came surging around him on the shore.
\v 22 Then Jairus— a leader of the Jewish meeting house— saw Jesus, threw himself prostrate before him,
\v 23 and fervently began begging him again and again, “My little daughter is at the point of death! Please come heal her by placing your hands on her. Please don’t let her die.”
\v 24 So Jesus went with him. A large crowd was following him, pressing in around him on all sides.
\p
\v 25 In that crowd there was a woman who had lived with a bloody discharge every day for twelve years.
\v 26 She had suffered from many remedies prescribed by doctors, but they only made the problem worse. Plus she had spent all her money searching for a cure.
\v 27 But now, having heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his tunic,
\v 28 for she was thinking, “If I just touch his clothing, I’ll be healed.”
\v 29 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she could clearly feel that her suffering was over.
\v 30 That very moment, Jesus knew that somebody had been healed by his power. Turning around in the crowd he asked, “Who touched my tunic?”
\p
\v 31 Some of his disciples quipped back, “What a thing to say! People are jostling all around you, and you ask, ‘‘Who touched me?’”
\p
\v 32 But still he kept on looking around to see the one who had done it,
\v 33 until the woman, trembling with fear and fully aware of what had happened to her, came and threw herself prostrate at his feet, and told him all the truth.
\v 34 “Dear daughter,” he said, “you have been healed because you fully believe in me. Go now with a calm heart. You truly are cured.”
\p
\v 35 Just as Jesus was saying that, several people came from Jairus’ house and said to him, “Your daughter has just passed away. There’s nothing the teacher can do now.”
\v 36 But Jesus overheard this and said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid. Keep on believing in me.”
\p
\v 37 At this point, Jesus gave orders that no one could go along with him except Peter and the brothers James and John.
\v 38 Everything was in an uproar when they arrived at Jairus house, with everyone weeping and loudly wailing.
\v 39 Upon entering Jesus said, “Why are you wailing and making all this noise? The girl is just sleeping, not dead.”
\v 40 Their response, however, was to make fun of him. But then Jesus sternly made them all leave the house. Then he had all those remaining— Jairus, the girl’s mother, and the three disciples— go with him into the room where the girl was lying.
\v 41 Then, taking hold of her hand, he said to her in Aramaic, “Talitha, koumi;” which means, “Little girl, get up.”
\v 42 The twelve year old girl instantly got up and began walking around. Everyone was completely overcome with amazement,
\v 43 but Jesus strictly forbid them to tell anyone about this miracle, and told her parents to give her something to eat.
