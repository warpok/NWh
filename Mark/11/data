\c 11
\p
\v 1 .When they were getting near Jerusalem and had arrived at the villages of Bethsphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead with these instructions:
\v 2 “As soon as you enter the village ahead, you will find a young donkey tied there upon which no one has ever ridden. Untie him and bring him here.
\v 3 And if any one asks you, ‘‘Why are you doing that?’ say, ‘The Master needs it, and will send it back here right away.’”
\p
\v 4 So they went and found the young donkey tied up at the front door of a house. They were untying it,
\v 5 when some of the bystanders called out, “What are you doing, untying that donkey?”
\v 6 They answered as Jesus had told them, and the people let them take it.
\p
\v 7 So they brought the donkey to Jesus, and covered it’s back with their tunics, and Jesus got on to ride it.
\v 8 Then many others carpeted the road with their tunics, and others laid down leafy branches which they had cut from trees.
\v 9 Then those who led the way and those who followed kept shouting,
\q1 “Praise God!
\q1 May God bless this king whom he sent to rule us!\x + \xo 11:9 \xt Psa. 118:25-26\x*
\q1
\v 10 The Lord will lead our new king to restore our forefather David’s kingdom.
\q2 May our praise ascend all the way to God’s throne!”
\p
\v 11 It was already late when Jesus entered Jerusalem. After entering the temple briefly, he and the twelve disciples went back out to Bethany.
\p
\v 12 The next morning, on his way back from Bethany to the temple, he was hungry.
\v 13 Seeing a fig tree with a lot of leaves in the distance he went over to see if he could find some early figs on it, since it was not yet the fig season. But finding the tree had no fruit, only leaves,
\v 14 he said to it, “Starting now, no one will ever eat fruit from you!” His disciples heard him say this.
\p
\v 15 When they reached Jerusalem and entered the Temple, Jesus threw out the merchants there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the stools of the pigeon-dealers,
\v 16 and would not allow any one to carry anything through the Temple.
\v 17 He told everyone there, “It is written in God’s Word,
\q1 ‘‘My House shall be called the House of Prayer For All Nations.’\x + \xo 11:17 \xt Isa. 56:7 LXX\x*
\m But you have made it what it has now become— ‘a robbers’ cave.’”\x + \xo 11:17 \xt Jer. 7:11 LXX\x*
\p
\v 18 The teachers of Jewish law and the high priests soon heard about what Jesus had done. They began to devise means to destroy him, but were afraid of him, because of the deep impression produced on all the people by His teaching.
\v 19 Every evening during this time, it was the practice of Jesus and his disciples to leave the city.
\v 20 In the early morning, they again saw that same fig tree as they passed by. It was already withered to the roots.
\v 21 Peter drew Jesus’ attention to it saying, “Look, Teacher, the fig tree which you cursed is withered up.”
\p
\v 22-23 Jesus said to them, “Remember this truth: Fully believe that God listens to your prayers. You might even ask God to throw this mountain into the ocean. If you refuse to allow doubt to creep into your heart and steadfastly believe that God will answer your prayer, it will happen.
\v 24 That is why I tell you that whatever you ask God for in prayer, believe that you are in the process of receiving it, and it will be given to you.
\v 25 But if you are praying and you realize that you are holding a grudge against someone, forgive that person, so that your Father in heaven will also forgive what you have done wrong.”
\v 26 But if you don’t forgive others, then neither will your Father in heaven forgive you.”
\p
\v 27 They came again to Jerusalem. As Jesus was walking in the temple courts, some high priests, leaders among the Jews, and teachers of Jewish law came to Him
\v 28 and asked, “Who gave you the authority teach here, or the right to change our customs?— like what you did yesterday.”
\p
\v 29 Jesus replied, “First I will ask you a question. Then if you can answer me, I will tell you by what right and authority I do these things.
\v 30 Did John’s authority to baptize people come from God, or was that just his own idea? Answer me.”
\v 31 Talking it over among themselves, they reasoned, “If we say that God gave John the authority, then he will ask us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe John?’
\v 32 But we can’t say it was just John’s idea to baptize people!” They said this because they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone except them believed that John really was a Prophet.
\v 33 So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
\p And he responded, “Then neither will I tell you who gave me the right and authority to do what I do.”
