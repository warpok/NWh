\v 1 Then one day some members of the Pharisee sect and teachers of Jewish law had come from Jerusalem to find out things about Jesus.
\v 2 They found a reason to criticize when they noticed that some of his disciples were eating food without doing the customary Jewish hand-rinsing ceremony.\f + \fr 7:2 \fk without doing … \ft Text: κοιναῖς χερσί, τοῦτ᾽ ἔστιν ἀνίπτοις, ἐσθίοντας ἄρτους, (having) common hands, which means eating bread with unrinsed hands. The word ‘common’ contrasts with the status of ceremonial cleanness. According to Jewish custom, before eating one needed to rinse their cupped hands. This ceremony, which was not part of the Jewish law, is quite different from actually washing one’s hands with soap.\f*
\v 3 (Let the reader understand that Jews in general, and especially members of the the Pharisee sect, never eat anything without first rinsing their cupped hands, which is one of the traditions handed down from their ancestors.
\v 4 Another tradition is pouring water\f + \fr 7:4 \fk pouring water \ft Text: βαπτίσωνται, baptize. Later in the verse: βαπτισμοὺς, baptisms. This verse shows twice that the word ‘baptize’ had a wider meaning than to totally immerse something or someone. See John 2:6 for a little more information about the size of water jars used for Jewish rites of purification.\f* on themselves before eating after coming home from a public place, such as a market. And they follow a good many other customs handed down from their ancestors, such as pouring water on cups, pots, bronze utensils, and low couches for reclining at meals.)
\v 5 So the Pharisees and teachers of Jewish law showed their disapproval by saying to Jesus, “What’s up with your disciples not following the customs handed down to us? They’re eating bread without first rinsing their hands!”
\p
\v 6 Jesus responded, “You are the kind of hypocrites that the prophet Isaiah wrote about. He described you perfectly in the words, ‘These people honour me with their lips, while their hearts are far away from me.
\v 7 They go through the motions of worshipping me while they teach nothing but man-made rules and religion.’\x + \xo 7:7 \xt Is. 29:13 LXX\x*
\p
\v 8 “Just so, you ignore God’s commands while you major in teaching human traditions, like the correct way to wash cups, pitchers, and many other things.
\v 9 You have become so very clever at substituting your own traditions for following God’s commands!
\v 10 For Moses commanded, ‘‘Honor your father and your mother’ and also, ‘‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be given the death penalty.’
\v 11 But you teach that a man can tell his father or mother, ‘I can no longer help you by giving that animal (or object) to you, because I have already vowed to give it as a Korban.’ (A Korban is something that the owner has promised to give to God as a sacrifice.)
\v 12 So by your teaching, you provide an excuse whereby people can disregard the needs of their parents.
\v 13 This is only one example out of many where you nullify God’s clear intention by the traditions you have elevated above God’s Word.”
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus called the crowd to gather around to hear this announcement, “Everyone listen to me and understand this:
\v 15 It is not the kind of food or drink which you consume that make you unacceptable in God’s sight. Rather, it is the things which you bring out from inside that make you unacceptable to God.
\v 16 Don’t let this teaching go in one ear and out the other!”
\p
\v 17 After he had left the crowd and gone indoors, his disciples asked him about this word picture.
\v 18 He replied, “Come now! You ought to be able to understand this! The external things we eat or drink can never make us unacceptable in God’s sight,
\v 19 because those things don’t go into our hearts, but just pass through our digestive system.” (Note that by Jesus saying this, he declared that every kind of food is acceptable for us in God’s sight.)
\v 20 Jesus continued, “It’s the things which eventually come out from inside of you that make you unacceptable to God.
\v 21 For all your evil intentions come from inside your hearts and minds, including desires to commit adultery, or other kinds of forbidden sexual acts, or murder.
\v 22 Other evil intentions include plans to steal something, or desires to own something that belongs to someone else. This list also includes having malicious thoughts toward someone else, making plans to defraud someone, or envying someone. And finally other evil intentions include unbridled lust, slandering someone, pride, and all kinds of stupid reckless acts.
\v 23 God sees all such evil intentions and behavior, and they make people unacceptable in His sight.”
\p
\v 24 Then he left Galilee and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon. There he wanted to remain an anonymous stranger as a guest in some house, but news about this particular stranger proved impossible to suppress.
\v 25 So a woman whose little daughter was being controlled by an evil spirit heard of him, and came and flung herself at his feet.
\v 26 She was a non-Jewish, Syro-phoenician woman, and she was repeatedly begging Jesus to banish the demon from her daughter.
\v 27 But he said to her, “First let the children eat all they want. It’s not right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs.”
\p
\v 28 “True, Sir,” she replied, “and yet the dogs under the table eat the little bits that get dropped when the children eat.”
\p
\v 29 “Because you have given such a good answer, I agree. When you arrive home you will find that the demon has left your daughter.”
\v 30 She found the girl lying in bed, and the demon was gone.
\p
\v 31 Returning from the region of Tyre and Sidon, Jesus and his disciples travelled along the shores of Lake Galilee to the center of the region called Ten Towns.
\v 32 Here they brought to him a deaf man who could hardly talk, and they begged Him to lay his hands on the man.
\v 33 So Jesus took him aside, to be alone with him away from the crowd. First Jesus put his fingers into the man’s ears, then he took some of his own spit and moistened the man’s tongue.
\v 34 Then, looking up to heaven and with a deep sigh, Jesus said, “Effatha!” (In Aramaic\f + \fr 7:34 \fk Aramaic \ft Aramaic was the common daily language in Palestine at the time of Jesus, not Greek or Hebrew. Aramaic is linguisticly similar to Hebrew.\f* that means, “0pen up!”)
\v 35 Immediately the man could hear perfectly and the impediment of his tongue was taken away, and he began to speak clearly.
\v 36 Then Jesus commanded the crowd to not tell anyone what had just happened. But the more he told people to not spread news, the more they did it, proclaiming it everywhere.
\v 37 After all, everyone was overwhelmed with amazement. They kept saying, “It seems there’s nothing he can’t do! He even makes deaf men hear and speech impediments disappear!”
