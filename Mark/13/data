\c 13

\v 1 As He was leaving the Temple, one of His disciples exclaimed, “Teacher, look at how marvelous these buildings are, made of such massive stones!”
\v 2 And Jesus replied, “Yes, take a good look at these great buildings. All of this will be demolished. Not a single stone will be left in its current position on top of another.”
\v 3 Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite to the Temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him pritvately,
\v 4 “Tell us, when will that disaster happen, and what will be the warning signs that will lead up to that time?”
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered, “Watch out that no one misleads you,
\v 6 because many will come saying, ‘I am Jesus. I am the Christ you have been waiting for.’ And they will mislead many.
\v 7 You will hear of wars waged in other places, and threats of wars about to take place where you are. Don't worry that God is not in control, because these things will happen repeatedly before the end comes.
\v 8 There will be wars between ethnic people groups and between kingdoms. Also in various places there will be earthquakes, famines, and severe unrest. These miseries are just the start of start, like the early pains of childbirth, boding worse suffering to come.
\p
\v 9 “You yourselves must be on your guard, because people will oppose you and take you before religious councils in Jewish meeting houses, and there you will be cruelly beaten. Then some of you will be taken to be judged by governors and kings. All this will happen because you are following me, and so that you can tell them about me.
\v 10 In fact, before the end of this age, the Good News about me must be proclaimed to all nations and people groups.
\v 11 When however they are marching you along under arrest, do not be anxious with thinking beforehand about what you are going to say. Just speak whatever occurs to you when the time comes, for it actually won’t be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
\v 12 “The persecution will be so severe against you that there will be brothers who betray their own brother so that he will be executed, and fathers will even betray their own children. There will also be children will rebel so much against their parents that they turn them over to authorities to be executed.
\v 13 You will be objects of universal hatred because you will be identified as followers of me. But stand firm to the end of your life, and your soul will be saved.
\p
\v 14 (Here I, Mark, ask that the one reading out loud to others explain this next part.)
\p “As soon, however, as you see the enemies of God's people setting up the ‘terrible defiling thing’ where it should not be, as predicted by the prophet Daniel,\x + \xo 13:14 \xt Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11\x* then those living in Judea must run to the hills to escape.
\v 15 If you are on the roof or porch of your house, don't take the time to go into your house to get anything. Just run away!
\v 16 The same goes if you are working in your garden. Don't go back to get your tunic. Just run.
\v 17 And how hard it will be at that time for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
\v 18 Pray that this time of terrible suffering will not come in the winter, making it even harder to run away.
\v 19 For the anguish of that time will be worse than all the other times of distress since the creation of the world, and nothing like it will ever happen again.\x + \xo 13:19 \xt Dan. 12:1\x*
\v 20 But because God has taken mercy on his chosen people, some of whom will still be alive at that time, he has decided that this disaster will not last too long. Becasue if it did, not a single person would be left alive.
\p
\v 21 “At that time if any one says to you, ‘Hey look! The Christ that we are waiting for is here,’ or ‘He is over there,’ do not believe it.
\v 22 For in that time various false Christs and false prophets will appear, and they will make all kinds of miracles happen to lead you astray. Their trickery will be so good that even God's chosen people will almost fall for it.
\v 23 So be on your guard! Remember that I have forewarned you about all this.
\p
\v 24 “However, following that time of severe anguish, God will darken the light of the sun and the moon will not shine at all.
\v 25 The stars will fall from the sky, and the spiritual forces of darkness in the sky will be cast down.\x + \xo 13:25 \xt Isa. 13:10; 34:4; Ez. 32:7; Joel 2:10; 2:31; 3:15\x*
\v 26 Then at that time people will see me, the prophesied Son of Adam, coming in clouds with great power and the bright radiance of his presence.
\v 27 Then I will send out my angels to gather together my chosen people from every place on earth, even from the extremities of the north, south, east and west.
\p
\v 28 “Take a clue about the signs of the time of my coming from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.
\v 29 So also, when you see the things I have just spoken about happening, then know that I am near, on the verge of appearing.
\v 30 Remember this truth: All the signs I have mentioned will soon happen while some of the present generation are still living to witness them.
\v 31 The earth and sky will one day cease to exist, but my words will forever be valid, never ever loosing their force.
\p
\v 32 “But as to that day or the exact time of my returning, no one knows. The angels in heaven don't know the time, and I, as the heavenly Father's Son, do not know. Only the Father knows.
\v 33 So be ready, keep on being watchful and pray, for you do not know when it will happen.
\v 34 It is like a wealthy man who is leaving his estate to go and live abroad. Before leaving he puts each of his employees in charge of certain tasks. In particular, he orders the one in charge of the front door to keep being watchful.
\v 35 In the same way you must stay alert and watchful, for you don't know when the owner will return to see what you are doing. It could happen in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows before dawn, or at daybreak.
\v 36 If he suddenly arrives with no warning, don't let him find you asleep and unprepared.
\v 37 I say this not just to you listening to me now, but to everyone: Keep being watchful!”
