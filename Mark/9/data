\c 9
\p
\v 1 Jesus went on to say, “I want you to remember this truth: Some of you standing here now will not die until after you have seen the start of God ruling powerfully on earth as king."
\p
\v 2 Six days later, Jesus took just three disciples— Peter, James, and John— and climbed up a high mountain with them. Then, in their presence, his appearance was transformed,
\v 3 and his clothes became dazzling white like snow, whiter than any earthly bleach could make them.
\v 4 The three disciples also saw Elijah and Moses appear and talk with Jesus.
\p
\v 5-6 The three disciples were stunned and terrified. Then Peter, not really knowing what to say, said it anyway, “Teacher, it's so good to be up here with you! How about if we put up three tents?— one each for you, Moses, Elijah."
\p
\v 7 Then they were enveloped by a cloud where a voice told them, “This is my Son, and I love him so dearly. Listen to him."
\v 8 Instantly the cloud vanished, and only Jesus was with them.
\p
\v 9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus very strictly forbid them, “Don't say a word about what you saw until I, the Son of Adam, have come back to life after being among the dead."
\p
\v 10 So the three men kept what they had seen up there to themselves, although they on several occasions discussed what Jesus could have meant by ‘coming back to life after being among the dead'.
\p
\v 11 On the way down, the three asked him, “Why is it that the teachers of Jewish law say that Elijah must come back to life before the Messiah comes?"
\p
\v 12 Jesus answered, “It is true that Elijah must come first to get people ready. But also consider that it is written in God's Word that the Son of Adam will endure much suffering and be rejected.
\v 13 Yet I tell you that not only has Elijah already come, but our leaders treated him horribly, just as God's Word says they wanted to do to the first Elijah."\x + \xo 9:13 \xt Mat. 17:13\x*
\p
\v 14 As they rejoined the other disciples, they saw an immense crowd surrounding them and some teachers of Jewish law hotly debating with them.
\v 15 Jesus himself showing up just then surprised them, and many ran forward to greet him.
\v 16 He then asked them, “What issue were you debating just now?”
\v 17 One in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought my son to ask for your help. An evil spirit stops him from being able to talk,
\v 18 and wherever it grabs him, it throws him on the ground. Then in his seizures he grinds his teeth and foams at the mouth. I begged your disciples to banish that demon, but they couldn't do it."
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered him and all the others, “How long do I have to put up with people who refuse to believe in me like you! How long do I have to work and then wait for you to catch on? Bring the boy to me."
\p
\v 20 So they brought him to Jesus. But the moment the demon saw Jesus, he threw the boy into convulsions, so that he fell down and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus asked the father, “How long has he been like this?"
\p His answer, “Since he was little.
\v 22 The demon wants to kill him, so he often throws him into the fire or pools of water. But, if you able, please have pity on us and help us."
\v 23 “Ha!" Jesus replied, “You doubt that I am able! I am able to do anything for people who fully believe in me."
\p
\v 24 Immediately the father cried out, “I do believe that you are able to help us! But please help me to believe more fully."
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus acted quickly as he saw that more and more people were running to join the crowd. He commanded the evil spirit, “You demon that makes this boy unable to speak and hear, I command you to come out of him and never enter him again."
\v 26 The demon caused the boy to scream, threw him into several violent convulsions, then left him. The boy looked as if he were dead, so that many onlookers said, “He's dead."
\v 27 But Jesus took his hand and helped him to stand.
\p
\v 28 Later, when Jesus and his disciples had gone in a house, they asked Him privately, “Why couldn't we banish that demon?"
\v 29 He answered, “That kind can only be banished if you first prepare yourself by praying and fasting."
\p
\v 30 When they left that place, they walked through Galilee. As they travelled, Jesus didn't want anyone to know who they were,
\v 31 because he was teaching His disciples, “I, the Son of Adam, will be betrayed into the hands of my enemies. They will murder me, but on the third day I will come back alive."
\v 32 They, however, did not understand what he meant, and were afraid to ask him about it.
\p
\v 33 They came to Capernaum, and when in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing about among yourselves on the way?"
\p
\v 34 But they didn't answer, because they had been arguing about which of them would be number one.
\v 35 Then Jesus sat down and called for all twelve of them to come and said to them, “If anyone of you wants to be number one, he must take the very last place and become the servant of all the rest."
\v 36 Then he called a little child had him stand before them. He hugged him while he told the disciples,
\v 37 “Whoever welcomes a child like this for my sake is simultaneously welcoming me, and whoever welcomes me, is at the same time welcoming my heavenly Father, who sent me."
\p
\v 38 Then John said, “Teacher, we saw a man using the authority of your name to banish demons, and we told him to stop doing that, because he's not one of the twelve of us."
\p
\v 39 But Jesus replied, “Don't tell someone like that to stop, because no one using the authority of my name to work a miracle is going to turn around the next minute and say bad things about me.
\v 40 Someone like that is not working against us, but for us.
\v 41 Remember this truth: Whoever shows their loyalty to me, the Christ, by helping you in some small way, like just giving you a drink of water, he will certainly be rewarded by God.
\v 42 On the other hand, if someone causes a little child like this one to fall away from believing in me, his punishment from God will be terrible. Being hurled into the sea with a heavy millstone tied around his neck would be a light punishment, compared to what he will experience.
\p
\v 43 “If your hand keeps grabbing things that cause you to fall into sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter into eternal life in heaven with just one hand, than to go to hell still having both hands, into that fire which cannot be put out.
\v 44 Just like it says in God's Word,
\q1 ‘In that place, the worms that eat them don't die,
\q2 and the fire torturing them never goes out.'\x + \xo 9:44 \xt Isa. 66:24\x*
\m
\v 45 Or if your feet keep going places where you to fall into sin, cut one of them off. It would be better for you to enter into eternal life in heaven with just one foot, than to go to hell with both feet, into that fire which will never go out.
\q1
\v 46 ‘In that place, the worms that eat them don't die,
\q2 and the fire torturing them never goes out.’
\m
\v 47 Or if your eyes keep looking at things that make you to fall into sin, tear one of them out. It would be better for you to enter into God's eternal kingdom with just one eye, than to be thrown into the eternal fires of hell.
\q1
\v 48 ‘In that place, the worms that will eat you won't die,
\q2 and the fire torturing you will never goes out.’
\p
\v 49 “Actually, each one of my followers will be tested by trials that feel like fire. Every sacrifice they make will bear good fruit, like how salt gives good flavor to meat roasted on the altar of the Lord.\f + \fr 9:49 \fk two metaphors \ft Text: 1) Πᾶς γὰρ πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται, 2) καὶ πᾶσα θυσία ἁλὶ ἁλισθήσεται, 1) For everyone will be salted with fire, 2) and every sacrifice will be salted (or seasoned) with salt. The NW interpretation for these two metaphors is well supported by commentators.\f*
\v 50 Salt is a good thing, and you who follow me should be like salt to everyone around you. But what if some salt looses its saltiness? There would be no way to restore its flavor. If you are being like salt, you will be a peacemaker and live at peace with those around you."\x + \xo 9:50 \xt Mat. 5:13-16\x*
