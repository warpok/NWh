\c 2
\v 1 I exhort then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men;
\v 2 including kings and all who are in high station, in order that we may live peaceful and tranquil lives with all godliness and gravity.
\v 3 This is right, and is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,
\v 4 who is willing for all mankind to be saved and come to a full knowledge of the truth.
\v 5 For there is but one God and but one Mediator between God and men--Christ Jesus, Himself man;
\v 6 who gave Himself as the redemption price for all--a fact testified to at its own appointed time,
\v 7 and of which I have been appointed a herald and an Apostle (I am speaking the truth: it is not a fiction), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
\v 8 So then I would have the men everywhere pray, lifting to God holy hands which are unstained with anger or strife;
\p
\v 9 and I would have the women dress becomingly, with modesty and self-control, not with plaited hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,
\v 10 but--as befits women making a claim to godliness--with the ornament of good works.
\v 11 A woman should quietly learn from others with entire submissiveness.
\v 12 I do not permit a woman to teach, nor have authority over a man, but she must remain silent.
\v 13 For Adam was formed first, and then Eve;
\v 14 and Adam was not deceived, but his wife was thoroughly deceived, and so became involved in transgression.
\v 15 Yet a woman will be brought safely through childbirth if she and her husband continue to live in faith and love and growing holiness, with habitual self-restraint.
